v</span>PREFATORY</h2>
<p>The following addresses were delivered at the request of
various literary societies and commemorative committees.&nbsp;
They amused me to write, and they apparently interested the
audiences for which they were primarily intended.&nbsp; Perhaps
they do not bear an appearance in print.&nbsp; But they are not
for my brother-journalists to read nor for the judicious men of
letters.&nbsp; I prefer to think that they are intended solely
for those whom Hazlitt styled &ldquo;sensible
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hazlitt said that &ldquo;the most sensible
people to be met with in society are men of business and of the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am hoping that these will buy my book and
that some of them will like it.</p>
<p>It is recorded by Sir Henry Taylor of Samuel Rogers that when
he wrote that very indifferent poem, <i>Italy</i>, he said,
&ldquo;I will make people buy.&nbsp; Turner shall illustrate my
verse.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is of no importance that the biographer of
Rogers tells <!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>us that the poet first made the
artist known to the world by these illustrations.&nbsp;
Taylor&rsquo;s story is a good one, and the moral worth taking to
heart.&nbsp; The late Lord Acton, most learned and most
accomplished of men, wrote out a list of the hundred best books
as he considered them to be.&nbsp; They were printed in a popular
magazine.&nbsp; They naturally excited much interest.&nbsp; I
have rescued them from the pages of the <i>Pall Mall
Magazine</i>.&nbsp; Those who will not buy my book for its seven
other essays may do so on account of Lord Acton&rsquo;s list of
books being here first preserved &ldquo;between
boards.&rdquo;&nbsp; I shall be equally well pleased.</p>

3</span>I.&nbsp; TO THE IMMORTAL MEMORY OF DR. SAMUEL
JOHNSON</h2>
<p>A toast proposed at the Johnson Birthday Celebration held at
the Three Crowns Inn, Lichfield, in September, 1906.</p>
<p>In rising to propose this toast I cannot ignore what must be
in many of your minds, the recollection that last year it was
submitted by a very dear friend of my own, who, alas! has now
gone to his rest, I mean Dr. Richard Garnett. <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a>&nbsp; Many of you who heard him in this
place will recall, with kindly memories, that venerable
scholar.&nbsp; I am one of those who, in the interval have stood
<!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>beside his open grave; and I know you will permit me to
testify here to the fact that rarely has such brilliant
scholarship been combined with so kindly a nature, and with so
much generosity to other workers in the literary field.&nbsp; One
may sigh that it is not possible to perpetuate for all time for
the benefit of others the vast mass of learning which such men as
Dr. Garnett are able to accumulate.&nbsp; One may lament even
more that one is not able to present in some concrete form, as an
example to those who follow, his fine qualities of heart and
mind&mdash;his generous faculty for &lsquo;helping lame dogs over
stiles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Garnett had not only a splendid erudition that specially
qualified him for proposing this toast, he had also what many of
you may think an equally exceptional qualification&mdash;he was a
native of Lichfield; he was born in this fine city.&nbsp; As a
Londoner&mdash;like Boswell when charged with the crime of being
a Scotsman I may say that I cannot help it&mdash;I suppose I
should come to you with hesitating footsteps.&nbsp; Perhaps it
was rash of me to come at all, in spite of an invitation so
kindly worded.&nbsp; Yet how gladly does any lover, not only of
Dr. Johnson, but of all good literature, <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>come to
Lichfield.&nbsp; Four cathedral cities of our land stand forth in
my mind with a certain magnetic power to draw even the most
humble lover of books towards them&mdash;Oxford, Bath, Norwich,
Lichfield, these four and no others.&nbsp; Oxford we all love and
revere as the nourishing mother of so many famous men.&nbsp; Here
we naturally recall Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s love of it&mdash;his
defence of it against all comers.&nbsp; The glamour of Oxford and
the memory of the great men who from age to age have walked its
streets and quadrangles, is with us upon every visit.&nbsp; Bath
again has noble memories.&nbsp; Upon house after house in that
fine city is inscribed the fact that it was at one time the home
of a famous man or woman of the past.&nbsp; Through its streets
many of our great imaginative writers have strolled, and those
streets have been immortalized in the pages of several great
novelists, notably of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens.</p>
<p>For the City of Norwich I have a particular affection, as for
long the home in quite separate epochs of Sir Thomas Browne and
of George Borrow.&nbsp; I recall that in the reign of one of its
Bishops&mdash;the father of Dean Stanley&mdash;there <!-- page
6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>was a
literary circle of striking character, that men and women of
intellect met in the episcopal palace to discuss all
&lsquo;obstinate questionings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But if he were asked to choose between the golden age of Bath,
of Norwich, or of Lichfield, I am sure that any man who knew his
books would give the palm to Lichfield, and would recall that
period in the life of Lichfield when Dr. Seward resided in the
Bishop&rsquo;s Palace, with his two daughters, and when they were
there entertaining so many famous friends.&nbsp; I saw the other
day the statement that Anna Seward&rsquo;s name was unknown to
the present generation.&nbsp; Now I have her works in nine
volumes <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a>; I have read them, and I doubt not but
that there are many more who have done the same.&nbsp; Sir Walter
Scott&rsquo;s friendship would alone preserve her memory if every
line she wrote <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>deserved to be forgotten as is too
readily assumed.&nbsp; Scott, indeed, professed admiration for
her verse, and a yet greater poet, Wordsworth, wrote in praise of
two fine lines at the close of one of her sonnets, that entitled
&lsquo;Invitation to a Friend,&rsquo; lines which I believe
present the first appearance in English poetry of the form of
blank verse immortalized by Tennyson.</p>
<blockquote><p>Come, that I may not hear the winds of night,<br
/>
Nor count the heavy eave-drops as they fall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You have well criticized the poetic powers of this
lady,&rdquo; says Wordsworth, &ldquo;but, after all, her verses
please me, with all their faults, better than those of Mrs.
Barbauld, who, with much higher powers of mind, was spoiled as a
poetess by being a dissenter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Less, however, can be said for her poetry to-day than for her
capacity as a letter writer.&nbsp; A letter writing faculty has
immortalized more than one English author, Horace Walpole for
example, who had this in common with Anna Seward, that he had the
bad taste not to like Dr. Johnson.</p>
<p>Sooner or later there will be a reprint of a selection of Anna
Seward&rsquo;s correspondence; you will find in it a picture of
country life in the <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>middle of the eighteenth
century&mdash;and by that I mean Lichfield life&mdash;that is
quite unsurpassed.&nbsp; Anna Seward, her friends and her
enemies, stand before us in very marked outline.&nbsp; As with
Walpole also, she must have written with an eye to
publication.&nbsp; Veracity was not her strong point, but her
literary faculty was very marked indeed.&nbsp; Those who have
read the letters that treat of her sister&rsquo;s betrothal and
death, for example, will not easily forget them.&nbsp; The
accepted lover, you remember, was a Mr. Porter, a son of the
widow whom Johnson married; and Sarah Seward, aged only eighteen,
died soon after her betrothal to him.&nbsp; That is but one of a
thousand episodes in the world into which we are introduced in
these pages. <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>The Bishop&rsquo;s Palace was the scene of brilliant
symposiums.&nbsp; There one might have met Erasmus Darwin of the
<i>Botanic Garden</i>, whose fame has been somewhat dulled by the
extraordinary genius of his grandson.&nbsp; There also came
Richard Edgeworth, the father of Maria, whose <i>Castle
Rackrent</i> and <i>The Absentee</i> are still among the most
delightful books that we read; and there were the two young
girls, Honora and Elizabeth Sneyd, who were destined in
succession to become Richard Edgeworth&rsquo;s wives.&nbsp;
There, above all, was Thomas Day, the author of <i>Sanford and
Merton</i>, a book which delighted many of us when we were <!--
page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>young, and which I imagine with all its priggishness
will always survive as a classic for children.&nbsp; There, for a
short time, came Major Andr&eacute;, betrothed to Honora Sneyd,
but destined to die so tragically in the American War of
Independence.&nbsp; It is to Miss Seward&rsquo;s malicious talent
as a letter writer that we owe the exceedingly picturesque
account of Day&rsquo;s efforts to obtain a wife upon a particular
pattern, his selection of Sabrina Sidney, whom he prepared for
that high destiny by sending her to a boarding school until she
was of the right age&mdash;his lessons in stoicism&mdash;his
disappointment because she screamed when he fired pistols at her
petticoats, and yelled when he dropped melted sealing-wax on her
bare arms; it is a tragi-comic picture, and one is glad that
Sabrina married some other man than her exacting guardian.&nbsp;
But we would not miss Miss Seward&rsquo;s racy stories for
anything, nor ignore her many letters with their revelation of
the glories of old-time Lichfield, and of those &lsquo;lunar
meetings&rsquo; at which the wise ones foregathered.&nbsp; Now
and again these worthies burst into sarcasm at one
another&rsquo;s expense, as when Darwin satirizes the publication
<!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>of Mr. Seward&rsquo;s edition of <i>Beaumont and
Fletcher</i>, and Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s edition of
<i>Shakspere</i></p>
<blockquote><p>From Lichfield famed two giant critics come,<br />
Tremble, ye Poets! hear them!&nbsp; Fe, Fo, Fum!<br />
By Seward&rsquo;s arm the mangled Beaumont bled,<br />
And Johnson grinds poor Shakspere&rsquo;s bones for bread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But perhaps after all, if we eliminate Dr. Johnson, the lover
of letters gives the second place, not to Miss Seward and her
circle, but to David Garrick.&nbsp; Lichfield contains more than
one memento of that great man.&nbsp; The actor&rsquo;s art is a
poor sort of thing as a rule.&nbsp; Johnson, in his tarter
moments, expresses this attitude, as when he talked of Garrick as
a man who exhibited himself for a shilling, when he called him
&lsquo;a futile fellow,&rsquo; and implied that it was very
unworthy of Lord Campden to have made much of the actor and to
have ignored so distinguished a writer as Goldsmith, when thrown
into the company of both.&nbsp; Still undoubtedly Johnson&rsquo;s
last word upon Garrick is the best&mdash;&lsquo;his death has
eclipsed the gaiety of nations and diminished the public stock of
harmless pleasure.&rsquo;&nbsp; We who live more than a hundred
years later are able to recognize that Garrick has been the one
<!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>great actor from that age to this.&nbsp; As a rule the
mummers are mimics and little more, and generations go on, giving
them their brief but glorious hour of fame, and then leaving them
as mere names in the history of the stage.&nbsp; Garrick was
preserved from this fate, not only by the circumstance that he
had an army of distinguished literary friends, but by his
interesting personality and by his own writings.&nbsp; Many lines
of his plays and prologues have become part of current
speech.&nbsp; Moreover his must have been a great personality, as
those of us who have met Sir Henry Irving in these latter days
have realized that his was also a great personality.&nbsp; It is
fitting, therefore, that these two great actors, the most famous
of an interesting, if not always an heroic profession, should lie
side by side in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>I now come to my toast &ldquo;The memory of Dr.
Johnson.&rdquo;&nbsp; After all, Johnson was the greatest of all
Lichfieldians, and one of the great men of his own and of all
ages.&nbsp; We may talk about him and praise him because we shall
be the better for so doing, but we shall certainly say nothing
new.&nbsp; One or two points, however, seem to me worthy of
emphasis in this company of Johnsonians.&nbsp; <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>I think we
should resent two popular fallacies which you will not hear from
literary students, but only from one whom it is convenient to
call &ldquo;the man in the street.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first is,
that we should know nothing about Johnson if it were not for
Boswell&rsquo;s famous life, and the second that Johnson the
author is dead, and that our great hero only lives as a brilliant
conversationalist in the pages of Boswell and others.&nbsp;
Boswell&rsquo;s <i>Life of Johnson</i> is the greatest biography
in the English language; we all admit that.&nbsp; It is crowded
with incident and anecdote.&nbsp; Neither Walter Scott nor
Rousseau, each of whom has had an equal number of pages devoted
to his personality, lives so distinctly for future ages as does
Johnson in the pages of Boswell.&nbsp; Understanding all this, we
are entitled to ask ourselves what we should have thought of Dr.
Johnson had there been no Boswell; and to this question I do not
hesitate to answer that we should have loved him as much as ever,
and that there would still have been a mass of material with the
true Boswellian flavour.&nbsp; He would not have made an appeal
to so large a public, but some ingenious person <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>would have
drawn together all the anecdotes, all the epigrams, all the
touches of that fine humanity, and given us from these various
sources an amalgam of Johnson, that every bookman at least would
have desired to read and study.&nbsp; In Fanny Burney&rsquo;s
<i>Letters and Diaries</i> the presentation of Johnson is
delightful.&nbsp; I wonder very much that all the Johnson
fragments that Miss Burney provides have not been published
separately.&nbsp; Then Mrs. Thrale has chatted about Johnson
copiously in her &ldquo;Anecdotes,&rdquo; and these pleasant
stories have been reprinted again and again for the
curious.&nbsp; I recall many other sources of information about
the great man and his wonderful talk&mdash;by Miss Hawkins, Miss
Reynolds, Miss Hannah More for example&mdash;and many of you who
have Dr. Birkbeck Hill&rsquo;s <i>Johnson Miscellanies</i> have
these in a pleasantly acceptable form.</p>
<p>My second point is concerned with Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s position
apart from all this fund of anecdote, and this brilliant
collection of unforgettable epigram in Boswell and
elsewhere.&nbsp; As a writer, many will tell you, Dr. Johnson is
dead.&nbsp; The thing is absurd on the face of it.&nbsp; There is
room for some disagreement as to his position as a poet.&nbsp;
<!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>On that question of poetry unanimity is ever hard to
seek; so many mistake rhetoric for poetry.&nbsp; Only twice at
the most, it seems to me, does Dr. Johnson reach anything in the
shape of real inspiration in his many poems, <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a> although it must be admitted that
earlier generations admired them greatly.&nbsp; To have been
praised ardently by Sir Walter Scott, by Byron, and by Tennyson
should seem sufficient to demonstrate that he was a poet, were it
not that, as I could prove if time allowed, poets are almost
invariably bad critics of poetry.&nbsp; Sir Walter Scott read
<i>The Vanity of Human Wishes</i> with &ldquo;a choking sensation
in the throat,&rdquo; and declared that he had more pleasure in
reading that and Johnson&rsquo;s other long poem, <i>London</i>,
than any other poetic compositions he could mention.&nbsp; But
then I think it was always the sentiment in verse, and not its
quality, that attracted Scott.&nbsp; Byron also declared that
<i>The Vanity of Human Wishes</i> was &ldquo;a great
poem.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Certainly these poems are quotable
poems.&nbsp; Who does not recall the line about &ldquo;surveying
mankind from China to Peru,&rdquo; or think, as Johnson taught
us, to:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Mark what ills the scholar&rsquo;s life assail,<br
/>
Toil, envy, want, the patron, and the jail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or remember his epitaph on one who:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Left a name at which the world grew pale,<br />
To point a moral or adorn a tale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One line&mdash;&ldquo;Superfluous lags the veteran on the
stage&rdquo; has done duty again and again.&nbsp; I might quote a
hundred such examples to show Johnson, whatever his qualities as
a poet, is very much alive indeed in his verse.&nbsp; It is,
however, as a great prose writer, that I prefer to consider
him.&nbsp; Here he is certainly one of the most permanent forces
in our literature.&nbsp; <i>Rasselas</i>, for example, while
never ranking with us moderns quite so high as it did with the
excellent Miss Jenkins in <i>Cranford</i>, is a never failing
delight.&nbsp; So far from being a dead book, is there a young
man or a young woman setting out in the world of to-day, aspiring
to an all-round literary cultivation, who <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>is not
required to know it?&nbsp; It has been republished
continually.&nbsp; What novelist of our time would not give much
to have so splendid a public recognition as was provided when
Lord Beaconsfield, then Mr. Disraeli, after the Abyssinian
Expedition, pictured in the House of Commons &ldquo;the elephants
of Asia dragging the artillery of Europe over the mountains of
Rasselas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Equally in evidence are those wonderful <i>Lives of The
Poets</i> which Johnson did not complete until he was seventy-two
years of age, literary efforts which have always seemed to me to
be an encouraging demonstration that we should never allow
ourselves to grow old.&nbsp; Many of these &lsquo;Lives&rsquo;
are very beautiful.&nbsp; They are all suggestive.&nbsp; Only the
other day I read them again in the fine new edition that was
prepared by that staunch Johnsonian, Dr. Birkbeck Hill.&nbsp; The
greatest English critic of these latter days, Mr. Matthew Arnold,
showed his appreciation by making a selection from them for
popular use.&nbsp; From age to age every man with the smallest
profession of interest in literature will study them.&nbsp; Of
how many books can this be said?</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Greatest of all was Johnson as a writer in his least
premeditated work, his <i>Prayers and Meditations</i>.&nbsp; They
take rank in my mind with the very best things of their kind,
<i>The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius</i>, <i>The Confessions of
Rousseau</i>, and similar books.&nbsp; They are healthier than
any of their rivals.&nbsp; William Cowper, that always
fascinating poet and beautiful letter writer, more than once
disparaged Johnson in this connexion.&nbsp; Cowper said that he
would like to have &ldquo;dusted Johnson&rsquo;s jacket until his
pension rattled in his pocket,&rdquo; for what he had said about
Milton.&nbsp; He read some extracts, after Johnson&rsquo;s death,
from the <i>Meditations</i>, and wrote contemptuously of them. <a
name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a>&nbsp; But if Cowper had always
possessed, in addition to his <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>fascinating
other-worldliness the healthy worldliness of Dr. Johnson, perhaps
we should all have been the happier.&nbsp; To me that collection
of <i>Prayers and Meditations</i> seems one of the most helpful
books that I have ever read, and I am surprised that it is not
constantly reprinted in a handy form. <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; It is a
valuable inspiration to men to keep up their spirits under
adverse conditions, to conquer the weaknesses of their natures;
not in the stifling manner of Thomas &agrave; Kempis, but in a
breezy, robust way.&nbsp; Yes, I think that these three works,
<i>Rasselas</i>, <i>The Lives of the Poets</i>, and the
<i>Prayers and Meditations</i>, make it quite clear that Johnson
still holds his place as one of our greatest writers, even if we
were not familiar with his many delightful letters, and had not
read his <i>Rambler</i>&mdash;which his old enemy, Miss Anna
Seward, insisted was far better than Addison&rsquo;s
<i>Spectator</i>.</p>
<p>All this is only to say that we cannot have too much of Dr.
Johnson.&nbsp; The advantage of such a gathering as this is that
it helps us to keep that <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>fact
alive.&nbsp; Moreover, I feel that it is a good thing if we can
hearten those who have devoted themselves to laborious research
connected with such matters.&nbsp; Take, for example, the work of
Dr. Birkbeck Hill: his many volumes are a delight to the Johnson
student.&nbsp; I knew Dr. Hill very well, and I have often felt
that his work did not receive half the encouragement that it
deserved.&nbsp; We hear sometimes, at least in London, of authors
who advertise themselves.&nbsp; I rather fancy that all such
advertisement is monopolized by the novelist, and that the
newspapers do not trouble themselves very much about literary men
who work in other fields than that of fiction.&nbsp; Fiction has
much to be said for it, but as a rule it reaps its reward very
promptly, both in finance and in fame.&nbsp; No such rewards come
to the writer of biography, to the writer of history, to the
literary editor.&nbsp; Dr. Hill&rsquo;s beautiful edition of
Boswell&rsquo;s <i>Life</i>, with all its fascinating annotation,
did not reach a second edition in his lifetime.&nbsp; I am afraid
that the sum that he made out of it, or that his publishers made
out of it, would seem a very poor reward indeed when gauged by
the results in other fields of labour.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>Within the past few weeks I have had the privilege of
reading a book that continues these researches.&nbsp; Mr. Aleyn
Lyell Reade has published a handsome tome, which he has privately
printed, entitled <i>Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s Ancestry</i>: <i>His
Kinsfolk and Family Connexions</i>.&nbsp; I am glad to hear that
the Johnson Museum has purchased a copy, for such a work deserves
every encouragement.&nbsp; The author must have spent hundreds of
pounds, without the faintest possibility of obtaining either fame
or money from the transaction.&nbsp; He seems to have employed
copyists in every town in Staffordshire, to copy wills, registers
of births and deaths, and kindred records from the past.&nbsp;
Now Dr. Birkbeck Hill could not have afforded to do this; he was
by no means a rich man.&nbsp; Mr. Reade has clearly been able to
spare no expense, with the result that here are many interesting
facts corrective of earlier students.&nbsp; The whole is a
valuable record of the ancestry of Dr. Johnson.&nbsp; It shows
clearly that whereas Dr. Johnson thought very little of his
ancestry, and scarcely knew anything of his grandfather on the
paternal or the maternal side, he really sprang from a very
remarkable <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>stock, notably on the maternal side;
and that his mother&rsquo;s family, the Fords, had among their
connexions all kinds of fairly prosperous people, clergymen,
officials, professional men as well as sturdy yeomen.&nbsp; These
ancestors of Dr. Johnson did not help him much to push his way in
the world.&nbsp; Of some of them he had scarcely heard.&nbsp; All
the same it is of great interest to us to know this; it in a
manner explains him.&nbsp; That before Samuel Johnson was born,
one of his family had been Lord Mayor of London, another a
Sheriff, that they had been associated in various ways, not only
with the city of his birth, but also with the great city which
Johnson came to love so much, is to let in a flood of fresh light
upon our hero.&nbsp; My time does not permit me to do more than
make a passing reference to this book, but I should like to offer
here a word of thanks to its author for his marvellous industry,
and a word of congratulation to him for the extraordinary success
that has accrued to his researches.</p>
<p>I mention Mr. Reade&rsquo;s book because it is full of
Lichfield names and Lichfield associations, and it is with Dr.
Johnson&rsquo;s life-long connexion with <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Lichfield
that all of us are thinking to-night.&nbsp; Now here I may say,
without any danger of being challenged by some visitor who has
the misfortune not to be a citizen of Lichfield&mdash;you who are
will not wish to challenge me&mdash;that this city has
distinguished itself in quite an unique way.&nbsp; I do not
believe that it can be found that any other town or city of
England&mdash;I will not say of Scotland or of Ireland&mdash;has
done honour to a literary son in the same substantial measure
that Lichfield has done honour to Samuel Johnson.&nbsp; The
peculiar glory of the deed is that it was done to the living
Johnson, not coming, as so many honours do, too late for a man to
find pleasure in the recognition.&nbsp; We know that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Seven wealthy towns contend for Homer dead,<br />
Through which the living Homer begged his bread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I doubt whether in the whole history of literature in
England it can be found that any other purely literary man has
received in his lifetime so substantial a mark of esteem from the
city which gave him birth, as Johnson did when your Corporation,
in 1767, &ldquo;at a common-hall of the bailiffs and citizens,
without any <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>solicitation,&rdquo; presented him
with the ninety-nine years&rsquo; lease of the house in which he
was born.&nbsp; Your citizens not only did that for Johnson, but
they gave him other marks of their esteem.&nbsp; He writes from
Lichfield to Sir Joshua Reynolds to express his pleasure that his
portrait has been &ldquo;much visited and much
admired.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Every man,&rdquo; he adds,
&ldquo;has a lurking desire to appear considerable in his native
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then we all remember Boswell&rsquo;s
na&iuml;ve confession that his pleasure at finding his hero so
much beloved led him, when the pair arrived at this very
hostelry, to imbibe too much of the famous Lichfield ale.&nbsp;
If Boswell wished, as he says, to offer incense to the spirit of
the place, how much more may we desire to do so to-night, when
exactly 125 years have passed, and his hero is now more than ever
recognized as a king of men.</p>
<p>I do not suggest that we should honour Johnson in quite the
same way that Boswell did.&nbsp; This is a more abstemious
age.&nbsp; But we must drink to his memory all the same.&nbsp;
Think of it.&nbsp; A century and a quarter have passed since that
memorable evening at the <i>Three Crowns</i>, when Johnson and
Boswell thus <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>foregathered in this very room.&nbsp;
You recall the journey from Birmingham of the two
companions.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are getting out of a state of
death,&rdquo; the Doctor said with relief, as he approached his
native city, feeling all the magic and invigoration that is said
to come to those who in later years return to
&ldquo;calf-land.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then how good he was to an old
schoolfellow who called upon him here.&nbsp; The fact that this
man had failed in the battle of life while Johnson had succeeded,
only made the Doctor the kinder.&nbsp; I know of no more human
picture than that&mdash;&ldquo;A Mr. Jackson,&rdquo; as he is
called by Boswell, &ldquo;in his coarse grey coat,&rdquo;
obviously very poor, and as Boswell suggests, &ldquo;dull and
untaught.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;great Cham of Literature&rdquo;
listens patiently as the worthy Jackson tells his troubles, so
much more patiently than he would have listened to one of the
famous men of his Club in London, and the hero-worshipping
Boswell drinks his deep potations, but never neglects to take
notes the while.&nbsp; Of Boswell one remembers further that
Johnson had told Wilkes that he had brought him to Lichfield,
&ldquo;my native city,&rdquo; &ldquo;that he might see for once
real Civility&mdash;for <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>you know he lives among savages in
Scotland, and among rakes in London.&rdquo;&nbsp; All good
stories are worth hearing again and again, and so I offer an
apology for recalling the picture to your mind at this time and
in this place.</p>
<p>Alas! I have not the gift of the worldfamed Lord Verulam, who,
as Francis Bacon, sat in the House of Commons.&nbsp; The members,
we are told, so delighted in his oratory that when he rose to
speak they &ldquo;were fearful lest he should make an
end.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am making an end.&nbsp; Johnson then was not
only a great writer, a conversationalist so unique that his
sayings have passed more into current speech than those of any
other Englishman, but he was also a great moralist&mdash;a superb
inspiration to a better life.&nbsp; We should not love Johnson so
much were he not presented to us as a man of many weaknesses and
faults akin to our own, not a saint by any means, and therefore
not so far removed from us as some more ethereal characters of
whom we may read.&nbsp; Johnson striving to methodize his life,
to fight against sloth and all the minor vices to which he was
prone, is the Johnson whom some of us prefer to keep ever in
mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here was,&rdquo; I quote <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Carlyle,
&ldquo;a strong and noble man, one of our great English
souls.&rdquo;&nbsp; I love him best in his book called <i>Prayers
and Meditations</i>, where we know him as we know scarcely any
other Englishman, for the good, upright fighter in this by no
means easy battle of life.&nbsp; It is as such a fighter that we
think of him to-night.&nbsp; Reading the account of <i>his</i>
battles may help us to fight ours.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I give you the toast of the evening.&nbsp; Let us
drink in solemn silence, upstanding, &ldquo;The Immortal Memory
of Dr. Samuel Johnson.&rdquo;</p>

31</span>II.&nbsp; TO THE IMMORTAL MEMORY OF WILLIAM COWPER</h2>
<p>An address entitled &lsquo;The Sanity of Cowper,&rsquo;
delivered at the Centenary Celebration at Olney, Bucks, on the
occasion of the Hundredth Anniversary of the Death of the poet
William Cowper, April 25, 1900.</p>
<p>I owe some apology for coming down to Olney to take part in
what I believe is a purely local celebration, in which no other
Londoner, as far as I know, has been asked to take part.&nbsp; I
am here not because I profess any special qualification to speak
about Cowper, in the town with which his name is so pleasantly
associated, but because Mr. Mackay, <a name="citation31"></a><a
href="#footnote31" class="citation">[31]</a> the son-in-law of
your Vicar, has written a book about the Bront&euml;s, and I have
done likewise, and he asked me to come.&nbsp; <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>This common
interest has little, you will say, to do with the Poet of
Olney.&nbsp; Between Cowper and Charlotte Bront&euml; there were,
however, not a few points of likeness or at least of
contrast.&nbsp; Both were the children of country clergymen; both
lived lives of singular and, indeed, unusual strenuousness; both
were the very epitome of a strong Protestantism; and yet
both&mdash;such is the inevitable toleration of genius&mdash;were
drawn in an unusual manner to attachment to friends of the Roman
Catholic Church&mdash;Cowper to Lady Throckmorton, who copied out
some of his translations from Homer for him, assisted by her
father-confessor, Dr. Gregson, and Miss Bront&euml; to her
Professor, M. H&eacute;ger, the man in the whole world whom she
most revered.&nbsp; Under circumstances of peculiar depression
both these great Protestant writers went further on occasion than
their Protestant friends would have approved, Cowper to
contemplate&mdash;so he assures us in one of his
letters&mdash;the entering a French monastery, and Miss
Bront&euml; actually to kneel in the Confessional in a Brussels
church.&nbsp; Further, let me remind you that there were moments
in the lives of Charlotte Bront&euml; and her sisters, when
Cowper&rsquo;s <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>poem, <i>The Castaway</i>, was their
most soul-stirring reading.&nbsp; Then, again, Mary Unwin&rsquo;s
only daughter became the wife of a Vicar of Dewsbury, and it was
at Dewsbury and to the very next vicar, that Mr. Bront&euml;, the
father of Charlotte, was curate when he first went into
Yorkshire.&nbsp; Finally, let it be recalled that Cowper and
Charlotte Bront&euml; have attracted as much attention by the
pathos of their lives as by anything that they wrote.&nbsp; Thus
far, and no further, can a strained analogy carry us.&nbsp; The
most enthusiastic admirers of the Bront&euml;s can only claim for
them that they permanently added certain artistic treasures to
our literature.&nbsp; Cowper did incomparably more than
this.&nbsp; His work marked an epoch.</p>
<p>But first let me say how interested we who are strangers
naturally feel in being in Olney.&nbsp; To every lover of
literature Olney is made classic ground by the fact that Cowper
spent some twenty years of his life in it&mdash;not always with
too genial a contemplation of the place and its
inhabitants.&nbsp; &ldquo;The genius of Cowper throws a halo of
glory over all the surroundings of Olney and Weston,&rdquo; says
Dean Burgon.&nbsp; But Olney <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>has claims
apart from Cowper.&nbsp; John Newton <a name="citation34"></a><a
href="#footnote34" class="citation">[34]</a> presents himself to
me as an impressive personality.&nbsp; There was a time, indeed,
of youthful impetuosity when I positively hated him, for Southey,
whose biography I read very early in life, certainly endeavours
to assist the view that Newton was largely responsible for the
poet&rsquo;s periodical attacks of insanity.</p>
<p>But a careful survey of the facts modifies any such
impression.&nbsp; Newton was narrow at times, he was
over-concerned as to the letter, often ignoring the spirit of
true piety, but the student of the two volumes of his <i>Life and
Correspondence</i> that we owe to Josiah Bull, will be compelled
to look at &ldquo;the old African blasphemer&rdquo; as he called
himself, with much of sympathy.&nbsp; That he had a note of
tolerance, with which he is not usually credited, we learn from
one of his letters, where he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am willing to be a debtor to the wise and to the
unwise, <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>to doctors and shoemakers, if I can
get a hint from any one without respect of parties.&nbsp; When a
house is on fire Churchmen and Dissenters, Methodists and
Papists, Moravians and Mystics are all welcome to bring
water.&nbsp; At such times nobody asks, &ldquo;Pray, friend, whom
do you hear?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What do you think of the five
points?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even my good friend Canon Benham, who has done so much to
sustain the honourable fame of Cowper, and who would have been
here to-day but for a long-standing engagement, is scarcely fair
to Newton. <a name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35"
class="citation">[35]</a>&nbsp; It is not true, as has been
suggested, that Cowper always changed his manner into one of
painful sobriety when he wrote to Newton.&nbsp; One of his most
humorous letters&mdash;a rhyming epistle&mdash;was addressed to
that divine.</p>
<blockquote><p>I have writ (he says) in a rhyming fit, what will
make you dance, and as you advance, will keep you still, though
against your will, dancing away, alert and gay, till you come to
an end of what I have penned; which you may do ere Madam and you
are quite worn out with jigging about, I take my leave, and here
you receive a bow profound, down to the ground, from your humble
me, W. C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>Now, I quote this very familiar passage from the
correspondence to remind you that Cowper could only have written
it to a man possessed of considerable healthy geniality.</p>
<p>At any rate, alike as a divine and as the author of the
<i>Olney Hymns</i>, Newton holds an important place in the
history of theology, and Olney has a right to be proud of
him.&nbsp; An even more important place is held by Thomas Scott,
<a name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a> and it seems to me quite a wonderful
thing that Olney should sometimes have held at one and the same
moment three such remarkable men as Cowper, Newton, and
Scott.</p>
<p>In my boyhood Scott&rsquo;s name was a household word, and
many a time have I thumbed the volumes of his
<i>Commentaries</i>, those <i>Commentaries</i> which Sir James
Stephen declared to be &ldquo;the greatest theological
performance of our age and country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of Scott
Cardinal Newman in his <i>Apologia</i> said, it will be
remembered, that &ldquo;to <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>him, humanly
speaking, I almost owe my soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even here our
literary associations with Olney and its neighbourhood are not
ended, for, it was within five miles of this town&mdash;at Easton
Maudit&mdash;that Bishop Percy <a name="citation37"></a><a
href="#footnote37" class="citation">[37]</a> lived and prepared
those <i>Reliques</i> which have inspired a century of ballad
literature.&nbsp; Here the future Bishop of Dromore was visited
by Dr. Johnson and others.&nbsp; What a pity that with only five
miles separating them Cowper and Johnson should never have
met!&nbsp; Would Cowper have reconsidered the wish made when he
read Johnson&rsquo;s biography of Milton in the <i>Lives of the
Poets</i>: &ldquo;Oh! I could thresh his old jacket till I made
his pension jingle in his pocket!&rdquo;?</p>
<p>But it is with Cowper only that we have here to do, and when
we are talking of Cowper the difficulty is solely one of
compression.&nbsp; So much has been written about him and his
work.&nbsp; The Lives of him form of themselves a most
substantial library.&nbsp; He has been made the subject of what
is surely the very worst biography in the <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>language and
of one that is among the very best.&nbsp; The well-meaning Hayley
<a name="citation38a"></a><a href="#footnote38a"
class="citation">[38a]</a> wrote the one, in which the word
&ldquo;tenderness&rdquo; appears at least twice on every page,
and Southey <a name="citation38b"></a><a href="#footnote38b"
class="citation">[38b]</a> the other.&nbsp; Not less fortunate
has the poet been in his critics.&nbsp; Walter Bagehot, James
Russell Lowell, Mrs. Oliphant, George Eliot <a
name="citation38c"></a><a href="#footnote38c"
class="citation">[38c]</a>&mdash;these are but a few of <!-- page
39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>the
names that occur to me as having said something wise and to the
point concerning the Poet of Olney.</p>
<p>I somehow feel that it is safer for me to refer to the Poet of
Olney than to speak of William Cowper, because I am not quite
sure how you would wish me to pronounce his name.&nbsp;
<i>Cooper</i>, he himself pronounced it, as his family are in the
habit of doing.&nbsp; The present Lord Cowper is known to all the
world as Lord Cooper.&nbsp; The derivation of the name and the
family coat-of-arms justify that pronunciation, and it might be
said that a man was, and is, entitled to settle the question of
the pronunciation of his own name.&nbsp; And yet I plead for what
I am quite willing to allow is the incorrect pronunciation.&nbsp;
All pronunciation, even of the simplest words, is settled finally
by a consensus of custom.&nbsp; Throughout the English-speaking
world the name is now constantly pronounced Cowper, as if that
most useful and ornamental animal the cow had given it its
origin.&nbsp; Well-read Scotland is peculiarly unanimous in the
custom, and well-read America follows suit.&nbsp; William
Shakspere, I doubt not, called himself Shaxspere, and we <!--
page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>decline to imitate him, and so probably many of us will
with a light heart go on speaking of William Cowper to the end of
the chapter.&nbsp; At any rate Shakspere and Cowper, divergent as
were their lives and their work&mdash;and one readily recognizes
the incomparably greater position of the former&mdash;had alike a
keen sense of humour, rare among poets it would seem, and hugely
would they both have enjoyed such a controversy as this.</p>
<p>This suggestion of the humour of Cowper brings me to my main
point.&nbsp; Humour is so essentially a note of sanity, and it is
the sanity of Cowper that I desire to emphasize here.&nbsp; We
have heard too much of the insanity of Cowper, of the
&ldquo;maniac&rsquo;s tongue&rdquo; to which Mrs. Browning
referred, of the &ldquo;maniacal Calvinist&rdquo; of whom Byron
wrote somewhat scornfully.&nbsp; Only a day or two ago I read in
a high-class journal that &ldquo;one fears that Cowper&rsquo;s
despondency and madness are better known to-day than his
poetry.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is not to know the secret of
Cowper.&nbsp; It is true that there were periods of maniacal
depression, and these were not always religious ones.&nbsp; Now,
it was from sheer nervousness at <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>the prospect
of meeting his fellows, now it was from a too logical acceptance
of the doctrine of eternal punishment.&nbsp; Had it not been
these, it would have been something else.&nbsp; It might have
been politics, or a hundred things that now and again give a
twist to the mind of the wisest.&nbsp; With Cowper it was
generally religion.&nbsp; I am not here to promote a
paradox.&nbsp; I accept the only too well-known story of
Cowper&rsquo;s many visitations, but, looking back a century, for
the purpose of asking what was Cowper&rsquo;s contribution to the
world&rsquo;s happiness and why we meet to speak of our love for
him to-day, I insist that these visitations are not essential to
our memory of him as a great figure in our literature&mdash;the
maker of an epoch.</p>
<p>Cowper lived for some seventy years&mdash;sixty-nine, to be
exact.&nbsp; Of these years there was a period longer than the
full term of Byron&rsquo;s life, of Shelley&rsquo;s or of
Keats&rsquo;s, of perfect sanity, and it was in this period that
he gave us what is one of the sanest achievements in our
literature, view it as we may.</p>
<p>Let us look backwards over the century&mdash;a century which
has seen many changes of which Cowper had scarcely any
vision&mdash;the <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>wonders of machinery and of
electricity, of commercial enterprise, of the newspaper press, of
book production.&nbsp; The galloping postboy is the most
persistent figure in Cowper&rsquo;s landscape.&nbsp; He has been
replaced by the motor car.&nbsp; Nations have arisen and fallen;
a thousand writers have become popular and have ceased to be
remembered.&nbsp; Other writers have sprung up who have made
themselves immortal.&nbsp; Burns and Byron, Coleridge and
Wordsworth, Scott and Shelley among the poets.</p>
<p>We ask ourselves, then, what distinctly differentiates
Cowper&rsquo;s life from that of his brothers in poetry, and I
reply&mdash;his sanity.&nbsp; He did not indulge in vulgar
amours, as did Burns and Byron; he did not ruin his moral fibre
by opium, as did Coleridge; he did not shock his best friends by
an over-weening egotism, as did Wordsworth; he did not spoil his
life by reckless financial complications, as did Scott; or by too
great an enthusiasm to beat down the world&rsquo;s conventions,
as did Shelley.&nbsp; I do not here condemn any one or other of
these later poets.&nbsp; Their lives cannot be summed up in the
mistakes they made.&nbsp; I only urge that, as it is not good to
be at warfare <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>with your fellows, to be burdened
with debts that you have to kill yourself to pay, to alienate
your friends by distressing mannerisms, to cease to be on
speaking terms with your family&mdash;therefore Cowper, who
avoided these things, and, out of threescore years and more
allotted to him, lived for some forty or fifty years at least a
quiet, idyllic life, surrounded by loyal and loving friends, had
chosen the saner and safer path.&nbsp; That, it may be granted,
was very much a matter of temperament, and for it one does not
need to praise him.&nbsp; The appeal to us of Robert Burns to
gently scan our brother man will necessarily find a ready
acceptance to-day, and a plea on behalf of kindly toleration for
any great writer who has inspired his fellows is natural and
honourable.&nbsp; But Cowper does not require any such kindly
toleration.&nbsp; His temperament led him to a placid life, where
there were few temptations, and that life with its quiet walks,
its occasional drives, its simple recreations, has stood for a
whole century as our English ideal.&nbsp; It is what, amid the
strain of the severest commercialism in our great cities, we look
forward to for our declining years as a haven on this side of the
grave.</p>
<p><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>But I have undertaken to plead for Cowper&rsquo;s
sanity.&nbsp; I desire, therefore, to beg you to look not at this
or that episode in his life, when, as we know, Cowper was in the
clutches of evil spirits, but at his life as a whole&mdash;a life
of serene contentment in the company of his friends, his hares
Puss, Tiny and Bess, his &ldquo;eight pair of tame
pigeons,&rdquo; his correspondents; and then I ask you to turn to
his work, and to note the essential sanity of that work also.</p>
<p>First there is his poetry.&nbsp; When after the Bastille had
fallen Charles James Fox quoted in one of his speeches
Cowper&rsquo;s lines&mdash;written long years
before&mdash;praying that that event might occur, he paid an
unconscious tribute to the sanity of Cowper&rsquo;s genius. <a
name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44"
class="citation">[44]</a>&nbsp; Few poets who have let their
convictions and aspirations find expression in verse have come so
near the mark.</p>
<p>Wordsworth&rsquo;s verse&mdash;that which was written at the
same age&mdash;is studded with prophecy of evils that never
occurred.&nbsp; It was not because of any supermundane
intelligence, such as latter-day poets have been pleased to
affect and latter-day <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>critics to assume for them, that
Cowper wrote in anticipation of the fall of the Bastille in those
thrilling lines, but because his exceedingly sane outlook upon
the world showed him that France was riding fast towards
revolution.</p>
<p>We have been told that Cowper&rsquo;s poetry lacked the true
note of passion, that there was an absence of the &ldquo;lyric
cry.&rdquo;&nbsp; I protest that I find the note of passion in
the &ldquo;Lines on the Receipt of my Mother&rsquo;s
Picture,&rdquo; in his two sets of verses to Mrs. Unwin, in his
sonnet to Wilberforce not less marked than I find it in other
great poets.&nbsp; I find in <i>The Task</i> and elsewhere in
Cowper&rsquo;s works a note of enthusiasm for human brotherhood,
for man&rsquo;s responsibility for man, for universal kinship,
that had scarcely any place in literature before he wrote quietly
here at Olney thoughts wiser and saner than he knew.&nbsp; To-day
we call ourselves by many names, Conservatives or Liberals,
Radicals, or Socialists; we differ widely as to ways and means;
but we are all practically agreed about one thing&mdash;that the
art of politics is the art of making the world happier.&nbsp;
Each politician who has any aspirations beyond mere ambition
desires to leave the world a little better <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>than he found
it.&nbsp; This is a commonplace of to-day.&nbsp; It was not a
commonplace of Cowper&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; Even the great-hearted,
lovable Dr. Johnson was only concerned with the passing act of
kindliness to his fellows; patriotism he declared to be the last
refuge of a scoundrel; collective aspiration was mere charlatanry
in his eyes, and when some one said that he had lost his appetite
because of a British defeat, Johnson thought him an impostor, in
which Johnson was probably right.&nbsp; There have been plenty of
so-called patriots who were scoundrels, there has been plenty of
affectation of sentiment which is little better than charlatanry,
but we do not consider when we weigh the influence of men whether
Rousseau was morally far inferior to Johnson.&nbsp; We know that
he was.&nbsp; But Rousseau, poor an instrument as he may have
been, helped to break many a chain, to relieve many a weary
heart, to bring to whole peoples a new era in which the horrors
of the past became as a nightmare, and in which ideals were
destined to reign for ever.&nbsp; Cowper, an incomparably better
man than Rousseau, helped to permeate England with that
collective sentiment, which, while it does not excuse us <!--
page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>for neglecting our neighbour, is a good thing for
preserving for nations a healthy natural life, a more and more
difficult task with the growing complications of
commercialism.&nbsp; Cowper here, as I say, unconsciously
performed his greatest service to humanity; and it was performed,
be it remembered, at Olney.&nbsp; It has been truly said that in
Cowper:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The poetry of human wrong begins, that long, long
cry against oppression and evil done by man to man, against the
political, moral, or priestly tyrant, which rings louder and
louder through Burns, Coleridge, Shelley, and Byron, ever
impassioned, ever longing, ever prophetic&mdash;never, in the
darkest time, quite despairing. <a name="citation47"></a><a
href="#footnote47" class="citation">[47]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Cowper achieved this without losing sight for one moment
of the essential necessity for personal worth:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spend all thy powers<br />
Of rant and rhapsody in Virtue&rsquo;s praise,<br />
Be most sublimely good, verbosely grand,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and it profiteth nothing, he said in effect.</p>
<p>That was not his only service as a citizen.&nbsp; He struck
the note of honest patriotism as it had not <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>been struck
before since Milton, by the familiar lines commencing:</p>
<blockquote><p>England, with all thy faults, I love thee
still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My country!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As also in that stirring ballad &ldquo;On the Loss of the
<i>Royal George</i>:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Her timbers yet are sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she may float again,<br />
Full charged with England&rsquo;s thunder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And plough the distant main.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two other great claims that might here be made for
Cowper did time allow, that he anticipated Wordsworth alike as a
lover of nature, as one who had more than a superficial affection
for it&mdash;the superficial affection of Thomson and
Gray&mdash;and that he anticipated Wordsworth also as a lover of
animal life.&nbsp; Cowper&rsquo;s love of nature was the less
effective than Wordsworth&rsquo;s only, surely, in that he had
not had Wordsworth&rsquo;s advantage of living amid impressive
scenery.&nbsp; His love of animal life was far less platonic than
Wordsworth&rsquo;s.&nbsp; To his hares and his pigeons and all
dumb creatures he was genuinely devoted.&nbsp; Perhaps it was
because he had in him the blood <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>of
kings&mdash;for, curiously enough, it is no more difficult to
trace the genealogical tree of both Cowper and Byron down to
William the Conqueror than it is to trace the genealogical tree
of Queen Victoria&mdash;it was perhaps, I say, this descent from
kings which led him to be more tolerant of &ldquo;sport&rdquo;
than was Wordsworth.&nbsp; At any rate, Cowper&rsquo;s vigorous
description of being in at the death of a fox may be contrasted
with Wordsworth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heart Leap Well,&rdquo; and you
will prefer Cowper or Wordsworth, as your tastes are for or
against our old-fashioned English sports.&nbsp; But even then, as
often, Cowper in his poetry was less tolerant than in his prose,
for he writes in <i>The Task</i> of:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detested
sport<br />
That owes its pleasures to another&rsquo;s pain,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may note in all this the almost entire lack of indebtedness
in Cowper to his predecessors.&nbsp; One of his most famous
phrases, indeed, that on &ldquo;the cup that cheers, but not
inebriates,&rdquo; he borrowed from Berkeley; but his borrowings
were few, far fewer than those of any other great poet, whereas
mine would be a long essay were I to produce by the medium of
<!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>parallel columns all that other poets have borrowed from
him.</p>
<p>Lastly, among Cowper&rsquo;s many excellencies as a poet let
me note his humour.&nbsp; His pathos, his humanity&mdash;many
fine qualities he has in common with others; but what shall we
say of his humour?&nbsp; If the ubiquitous Scot were present, so
far from his native heath&mdash;and I daresay we have one or two
with us&mdash;he might claim that humour was also the prerogative
of Robert Burns.&nbsp; He might claim, also, that certain other
great characteristics of Cowper were to be found almost
simultaneously in Burns.&nbsp; There is virtue in the
<i>almost</i>.&nbsp; Cowper was born in 1731, Burns in
1759.&nbsp; At any rate humour has been a rare product among the
greater English poets.&nbsp; It was entirely absent in
Wordsworth, in Shelley, in Keats.&nbsp; Byron possessed a gift of
satire and wit, but no humour, Tennyson only a suspicion of it in
&ldquo;The Northern Farmer.&rdquo;&nbsp; From Cowper to Browning,
who also had it at times, there has been little humour in the
greatest English poetry, although plenty of it in the lesser
poets&mdash;Hood and the rest.&nbsp; But there was in Cowper a
great sense of humour, as there was also plenty of what <!-- page
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>Hazlitt, almost censoriously, calls &ldquo;elegant
trifling.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not only in the imperishable &ldquo;John
Gilpin,&rdquo; but in the &ldquo;Case Between Nose and
Eyes,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Nightingale and Glow-worm,&rdquo; and
other pieces you have examples of humorous verse which will live
as long as our language endures.</p>
<p>Cowper&rsquo;s claims as a poet, then, may be emphasized under
four heads:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; His enthusiasm for humanity.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; His love of nature.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; His love of animal life.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; His humour.</p>
<p>And in three of these, let it be said emphatically, he stands
out as the creator of a new era.</p>
<p>There is another claim I make for him, and with this I
close&mdash;his position as a master of prose, as well as of
poetry.&nbsp; Cowper was the greatest letter-writer in a language
which has produced many great letter-writers&mdash;Walpole, Gray,
Byron, Scott, FitzGerald, and a long list.&nbsp; But nearly all
these men were men of affairs, of action.&nbsp; Given a good
literary style they could hardly have been other than
interesting, they had so much to say that they gained from
external sources.&nbsp; Even FitzGerald&mdash;the one <!-- page
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>recluse&mdash;had all the treasures of literature
constantly passing into his study.&nbsp; Cowper had but eighteen
books altogether during many of his years in Olney, and some of
us who have lent our volumes in the past and are still sighing
over gaps in our shelves find consolation in the fact that six of
Cowper&rsquo;s books had been returned to him after a friend had
borrowed for twenty years or so.&nbsp; Now, it is comparatively
easy to write good letters with a library around you; it is
marvellous that Cowper could have done this with so little
material, and his letters are, from this point of view, the best
of all&mdash;&ldquo;divine chit-chat&rdquo; Coleridge called
them.&nbsp; His simple style captivates us.&nbsp; And here let me
say&mdash;keeping to my text&mdash;that it is the <i>sanest</i>
of styles, a style with no redundancies, no rhetoric, no
straining after effect.&nbsp; The outlook on life is
sane&mdash;what could be finer than the chase for the lost hare,
or the call of the Parliamentary candidate, or the flogging of
the thief?&mdash;and the outlook on literature is particularly
sane.</p>
<p>Cowper was well-nigh the only true poet in the first rank in
English literature who was at the same time a true critic.&nbsp;
Literary history affords a singular revelation of the wild and
incoherent <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>judgments of their fellows on the
part of the poets.&nbsp; For praise or blame, there are few
literary judgments of Byron, of Shelley, of Wordsworth that will
stand.&nbsp; Coleridge was a critic first, and his poetry, though
good, is small in quantity, and the same may be said of Matthew
Arnold.&nbsp; Tennyson discreetly kept away from prose, and his
letters, be it remembered, lack distinction as do most letters of
the nineteenth century.&nbsp; If, however, as we are really to
believe, he it was who really made the first edition of
Palgrave&rsquo;s <i>Golden Treasury of Lyric Poetry</i>, he came
near to Cowper in his sanity of judgment, and one delights to
think that in that precious volume Cowper ranks third&mdash;that
is, after Shakspere and Wordsworth&mdash;in the number of
selections that are there given, and rightly given, as
imperishable masterpieces of English poetry.&nbsp; Tennyson,
also, was at one with Cowper in declaring that an appreciation of
<i>Lycidas</i> was a touchstone of taste for poetry.&nbsp; To
Tennyson, as to Cowper, Milton was the one great English poet
after Shakspere; and here, also, we revere the saneness of
view.&nbsp; More sane too, was Cowper than any of the <!-- page
54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>modern critics, in that he did not believe that mere
technique was the standpoint from which all poetry must
ultimately be judged.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Give me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;a manly
rough line with a deal of meaning in it, rather than a whole poem
full of musical periods, that have nothing in them, only
smoothness to recommend them!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And thus he justified Robert Browning and many another
singer.</p>
<p>Let us then dismiss from our minds the one-sided picture of
Cowper as a gloomy fanatic, who was always asking himself in
Carlylian phrase, &ldquo;Am I saved?&nbsp; Am I
damned?&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us remember him as staunch to the
friends of his youth, sympathetic to his old schoolfellow, Warren
Hastings, when the world would make him out too black.&nbsp;
Opposed in theory to tobacco, how he delighted to welcome his
good friend Mr. Bull.&nbsp; &ldquo;My greenhouse,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;wants only the flavour of your pipe to make it perfectly
delightful!&rdquo;&nbsp; Naturally tolerant of total abstinence,
he asks one friend to drink to the success of his Homer, and
thanks another for a present of bottle-stands.&nbsp; From
beginning to end, save in those periods of aberration, there is
no more <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>resemblance to Cowper in the picture
that certain narrow-minded people have desired to portray than
there is in these same people&rsquo;s conception of Martin
Luther.&nbsp; The real Luther, who loved dancing and mirth and
the joy of living as much as did any of the men he so
courageously opposed, was not more remote from a conception of
him once current in this country than was the real
Cowper&mdash;the frank, genial humorist, who wrote &ldquo;John
Gilpin,&rdquo; who in his youth &ldquo;giggled and made
giggle&rdquo; with his girl-cousins, and in his maturer years
&ldquo;laughed and made laugh&rdquo; with Lady Austen and Lady
Hesketh.</p>
<p>To all men there are periods of weariness and depression, side
by side with periods of happiness and hopefulness.&nbsp; Cowper,
alas! had more than his share of the tragedy of life, but let us
not forget that he had some of its joy, and that joy is reflected
for us in a substantial literary achievement, which has lived,
and influenced the world, while his more tragic experiences may
well be buried in oblivion.&nbsp; This, you may have noted, is
not a criticism of Cowper, but an eulogy.&nbsp; I would wish to
say, however, that the criticism of Cowper by living writers has
been of surpassing <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>excellence.&nbsp; For the first fifty
or sixty years of the century that we are recalling Cowper was
the most popular poet of our country, with Burns and Byron for
rivals.&nbsp; He has been largely dethroned by Wordsworth and
Shelley, and Tennyson, not one of whom has been praised too
much.&nbsp; But if Cowper has sunk somewhat out of sight of late
years, owing to inevitable circumstances, it is during these late
years that he has secured the goodwill of the best living
critics.&nbsp; Would that Mr. Leslie Stephen <a
name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a>&mdash;who wrote his life in the
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>&mdash;would that Mr.
Edmund Gosse&mdash;who has so recently published a great
biography of Cowper&rsquo;s memorable ancestor, Dr.
Donne&mdash;were, one or other of them, here to-day; or Mr.
Austin Dobson, who has visited Olney, and described his
impressions; or Dr. Jessopp, who lives near Cowper&rsquo;s tomb
in East Dereham Church.&nbsp; These writers are, alas! not with
us, and some presentment of a poet they love has fallen to less
capable hands.</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>But not the most brilliant of speeches, not all the
enthusiasm of all the critics, can ever restore Cowper to his
former immense popularity.&nbsp; We do well, however, to
celebrate his centenary, because it is good at certain periods to
remember our indebtedness to the great men who have helped us in
literature or in life.&nbsp; But that is not to say that we work
for the dethronement of later favourites.&nbsp; &ldquo;Each age
must write its own books,&rdquo; says Emerson, and this is
particularly the case with the great body of poetry.&nbsp;
Cowper, however, will live to all time among students of
literature by his longer poems; he will live to all time among
the multitude by his ballads and certain of his lyrics.&nbsp; He
will, assuredly, live by his letters, to study which will be a
thousand times more helpful to the young writer than many volumes
of Addison, to whom we were once advised to devote our days and
our nights.&nbsp; Cowper will live, above all, as a profoundly
interesting and beautiful personality, as a great and good
Englishman&mdash;the greatest of all the sons of this his adopted
town.</p>

61</span>III.&nbsp; TO THE IMMORTAL MEMORY OF GEORGE BORROW</h2>
<p>An Address delivered in Norwich on the Occasion of the Borrow
Centenary, 1903.</p>
<p>One hundred years ago there was born some two miles from the
pleasant little town of East Dereham, in this county, a child who
was christened George Henry Borrow.&nbsp; That is why we are
assembled here this evening.&nbsp; I count it one of the most
interesting coincidences in literary history that only three
years earlier there should have left the world in the same little
town&mdash;a town only known perhaps to those of us who are
Norfolk men&mdash;a poet who has always seemed to me to be one of
the greatest glories of our literature: I mean William
Cowper.&nbsp; Cowper died in April, 1800, and Borrow was born in
July, 1803, in this same town of East Dereham: and there very
much it might be thought, any point of likeness or of contrast
must surely end.</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>Cowper and Borrow do, indeed, come into some trivial
kind of kinship at one or two points.&nbsp; In reading
Cowper&rsquo;s beautiful letters I have come across two addressed
by him to one Richard Phillips, a bookseller of that day, who had
been in prison for publishing some of Thomas Paine&rsquo;s
works.&nbsp; Cowper had been asked by Phillips to write a
sympathetic poem denunciatory of the political and religious
tyranny that had sent Phillips to jail.&nbsp; Cowper had at first
agreed, but was afterwards advised not to have anything more to
do with Phillips.&nbsp; Judging by the after career of Phillips,
Cowper did wisely; for Phillips was not a good man, although
twenty years later he had become a sheriff of London and was
knighted.&nbsp; As Sir Richard Phillips he was visited by George
Borrow, then a youth at the beginning of his career.&nbsp; Borrow
came to Phillips armed with an introduction from William Taylor
of Norwich, and his reception is most dramatically recorded in
the pages of <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; This is, however, to
anticipate.&nbsp; Then there is a poem by Cowper to Sir John Fenn
<a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a> the antiquary, the <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>first editor
of the famous <i>Paston Letters</i>.&nbsp; In it there is a
reference to Fenn&rsquo;s spouse, who, under the pseudonym of
&ldquo;Mrs. Teachwell,&rdquo; wrote many books for children in
her day.&nbsp; Now Borrow could remember this lady&mdash;Dame
Eleanor Fenn&mdash;when he was a boy.&nbsp; He recalled the
&ldquo;Lady Bountiful leaning on her gold-headed cane, while the
sleek old footman followed at a respectful distance
behind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lady Fenn was forty-six years old when
Cowper referred to her.&nbsp; She was sixty-six when the boy
Borrow saw her in Dereham streets.&nbsp; At no other points do
these great East Dereham writers come upon common ground: Cowper
during the greater part of his life was a recluse.&nbsp; He
practically fled from the world.&nbsp; In reading the many
letters <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>he wrote&mdash;and they are among the
best letters in the English language&mdash;one is struck by the
small number of his correspondents.&nbsp; He had few
acquaintances and still fewer friends.&nbsp; He had never seen a
hill until he was sixty, and then it was only the modest hills of
Sussex that seemed to him so supremely glorious.&nbsp; He was
never on the Continent.&nbsp; For half a lifetime he did not move
out of one county, the least picturesque part of Buckinghamshire,
the neighbourhood of Olney and of Weston.&nbsp; There he wrote
the poems that have been a delight to several generations, poems
which although they may have gone out of fashion with many are
still very dear to some among us; and there, as I have said, he
wrote the incomparable letters that have an equally permanent
place in literature.</p>
<p>You could not conceive a more extraordinary contrast than the
life of this other writer associated with East Dereham, whom we
have met to celebrate this evening.&nbsp; George Borrow was the
son of a soldier, who had risen from the ranks, and of a mother
who had been an actress.&nbsp; Soldier and actress both imply to
all of us a restless, wandering life.&nbsp; The soldier was a
Cornishman <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>by birth, the actress was of French
origin, and so you have blended in this little Norfolk
boy&mdash;who is a Norfolk boy in spite of it all&mdash;every
kind of nomadic habit, every kind of fiery, imaginative
enthusiasm, a temperament not usually characteristic of those of
us who claim East Anglia as the land of our birth or of our
progenitors.&nbsp; I wish it were possible for me to reconstruct
that Norwich world into which young George Borrow entered at
thirteen years of age.&nbsp; That it was a Norwich of great
intellectual activity is indisputable.&nbsp; In the year of
Borrow&rsquo;s birth John Gurney, who died six years later, first
became a partner in the Norwich bank.&nbsp; His more famous son,
Joseph John Gurney&mdash;aged fifteen&mdash;left the Earlham home
in order to study at Oxford.&nbsp; His sister, the still more
famous Elizabeth Fry, was now twenty-three.&nbsp; So that when
Borrow, the thirteen year old son of the veteran
soldier&mdash;who had already been in Ireland picking up scraps
of Irish, and in Scotland adding to his knowledge of
Gaelic&mdash;settled down for some of his most impressionable
years in Norwich, Joseph John Gurney was a young man of
twenty-eight and Elizabeth Fry was thirty-six.&nbsp; <!-- page
66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>Dr.
James Martineau was eleven years of age and his sister Harriet
was fourteen.&nbsp; Another equally clever woman, not then
married to Austin, the famous jurist, was Sarah Taylor, aged
twenty-three.&nbsp; This is but to name a few of the crowd of
Norwich worthies of that day.&nbsp; Would that some one could
produce a picture of the literary life of Norwich of this time
and of a quarter of a century onward&mdash;a period that includes
the famous Bishop Stanley&rsquo;s <a name="citation66"></a><a
href="#footnote66" class="citation">[66]</a> occupancy of the See
of Norwich and the visits to this city from all parts of England
of a great number of famous literary men.&nbsp; It is my pleasant
occupation to-night to endeavour to show that Borrow, the very
least of these men and women in public estimation for a good
portion of his life, and perhaps the least in popular judgment
even since his death, was really the greatest, was really the man
of all others to whom this beautiful city should do honour if it
asks for a name out of its nineteenth century history to crown
with local recognition.</p>
<p><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>For whatever homage may have fallen to Borrow during the
half-century or more since his name first came upon many tongues
Norwich, it must be admitted, has given very little of it.&nbsp;
No one associated with your city, I repeat, but has heard of the
Gurneys and the Martineaus, of the Stanleys and the Austins,
whose life stories have made so large a part of your literary and
intellectual history during this very period.&nbsp; But I turn in
vain to a number of books that I have in my library for any
information concerning one who is indisputably the greatest among
the intellectual children of Norwich.&nbsp; I turn to Mr.
Prothero&rsquo;s <i>Life of Dean Stanley</i>&mdash;not one word
about Borrow; to that pleasant <i>Memoir</i> of Sarah Austin and
her mother, Mrs. Taylor, called <i>Three Generations of a Norfolk
Family</i>&mdash;again not one word.&nbsp; I turn to Mr.
Braithwaite&rsquo;s biography of Joseph John Gurney, and to Mr.
Augustus Hare&rsquo;s book <i>The Gurneys of
Earlham</i>&mdash;upon these worthy biographers Borrow made no
impression whatever, although Joseph John Gurney was personally
helpful to him and we read in <i>Lavengro</i> of that pleasant
meeting between the pair on the river bank when Mr. Gurney chided
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>the boy Borrow or Lavengro for angling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;From that day,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I became less and
less a practitioner of that cruel fishing.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
Harriet Martineau&rsquo;s <i>Autobiography</i>, which enjoyed its
hour of fame when it was published twenty-six years ago, there is
a contemptuous reference to the disciple of William Taylor,
&ldquo;this polyglot gentleman, who went through Spain
disseminating Bibles.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Miss Martineau were alive
now she would hear the works of &ldquo;this polyglot
gentleman&rdquo; praised on every hand, and would find that a
cult had arisen which to her would certainly be quite
incomprehensible.&nbsp; In that large, dismal book&mdash;the
<i>Life of James Martineau</i>, again, there is but one mention
of Dr. Martineau&rsquo;s famous schoolfellow whose name has been
linked with him only by a silly story.&nbsp; Do not let it be
thought that I am complaining of this neglect; the world will
always treat its greatest writers in precisely this
fashion.&nbsp; Borrow did not lack for fame of a kind, but he
was, as I desire to show, praised in his lifetime for the wrong
thing, where he was praised at all.&nbsp; Everyone in the fifties
and sixties read <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, as they read a
hundred other books of <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>that period, now forgotten.&nbsp;
Many read it who were deceived by its title.&nbsp; They expected
a tract.&nbsp; Many read it as we to-day read the latest novel or
biography of the hour.&nbsp; Then a new book arises and the
momentary favourite is forgotten.&nbsp; We think for a whole week
that we are in contact with a well-nigh immortal work.&nbsp; A
little later we concern ourselves not at all whether the book is
immortal or not.&nbsp; We go on to something else.&nbsp; The
critic is as much to blame as the reader.&nbsp; Not one man in a
hundred whose profession it is to come between the author and the
public, and to guide the reader to the best in literature, has
the least perception of what is good literature.&nbsp; It is easy
when a writer has captured the suffrages of the crowd for the
critic to tell the world that he is great.&nbsp; That happened to
Carlyle, to Tennyson, to many a popular author whose earliest
books commanded little attention: but, happily, these writers did
not lose heart.&nbsp; They kept on writing.&nbsp; Borrow was
otherwise made.&nbsp; He wrote <i>The Bible in Spain</i>&mdash;a
book of travel of surprising merit.&nbsp; It sold largely on its
title.&nbsp; Mr. Augustine Birrell has told us that he knew a boy
in a very <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>strict household who devoured the
narrative on Sunday afternoons, the title being thought to cover
a conventional missionary journey.&nbsp; Well, when I was a boy
<i>The Bible in Spain</i> had gone out of fashion and the public
had not taken up with the author&rsquo;s greater work,
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; Borrow was naturally disappointed.&nbsp;
He abused the critics and the public.&nbsp; Perhaps he grew
somewhat soured.&nbsp; He did not hesitate in <i>The Romany
Rye</i> to talk candidly about those &ldquo;ill-favoured dogs . .
. the newspaper editors,&rdquo; and he made the gentleman&rsquo;s
gentleman of <i>Lavengro</i> describe how he was excluded from
the Servants&rsquo; Club in Park Lane because his master followed
a profession &ldquo;so mean as literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact
as a reaction from the unfriendly reception accorded to the
<i>Romany Rye</i>&mdash;now one of the most costly of his books
in a first edition&mdash;he lost heart, and he grew to despise
the whole literary and writing class.&nbsp; Hence the various
stories presenting him in not very sympathetic guise, the story
of Thackeray being snubbed on asking Borrow if he had read the
<i>Snob Papers</i>, of Miss Agnes Strickland receiving an even
more forcible rebuff when she offered to send him her <i>Queens
of England</i>.&nbsp; <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake
don&rsquo;t Madame; I should not know where to put them or what
to do with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; These stories are in Gordon
Hake&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs of Eighty Years</i>, but Mr. Francis
Hindes Groome has shown us the other side of the picture, and
others also to whom I shall refer a little later have done the
same.&nbsp; Perhaps the literary class is never the worse for a
little plain speaking.&nbsp; The real secret of Borrow is
this&mdash;that he was a man of action turned into a writer by
force of circumstances.</p>
<p>The life of Borrow, unlike that of most famous men of letters,
has not been overwritten.&nbsp; His death in 1881 caused little
emotion and attracted but small attention in the
newspapers.&nbsp; <i>The Times</i>, then as now so excellent in
its biographies as a rule, devoted but twenty lines to him.&nbsp;
Here I may be pardoned for being autobiographical.&nbsp; I was
last in Norwich in the early eighties.&nbsp; I had a wild
enthusiasm for literature so far as my taste had been
directed&mdash;that is to say I read every book I came across and
had been doing so from my earliest boyhood.&nbsp; But I had never
heard of George Borrow or of his works.&nbsp; In my then not
infrequent <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>visits to Norwich I cannot recall
that his name was ever mentioned, and in my life in London, among
men who were, many of them, great readers, I never heard of
Borrow or of his achievement.&nbsp; He died in 1881, and as I do
not recall hearing his name at the time of his death or until
long afterwards, I must have missed certain articles in the
<i>Athenaeum</i>&mdash;two of them admirable
&ldquo;appreciations&rdquo; by Mr. Watts-Dunton&mdash;and so my
state of benightedness was as I have described.&nbsp; It may be
that those who are a year or two older than I am and those who
are younger may find this extraordinary.&nbsp; You have always
heard of Borrow and of his works, but I think I am entitled to
insist that when Borrow sank into his grave, an old, and to many
an eccentric and bitter man, he had fallen into the most curious
oblivion with the public that has ever come to a man, I will not
say of equal distinction, but of any distinction whatever.&nbsp;
Mr. Egmont Hake told the readers of the <i>Athenaeum</i> in a
biography that appeared at the time of Borrow&rsquo;s death that
Borrow&rsquo;s works were &ldquo;forgotten in England&rdquo; and
I find in turning to the biography of Borrow in <i>The <!-- page
73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>Norvicensian</i>, for 1882&mdash;the organ of the
Norwich Grammar School&mdash;that the writer of this obituary
notice confessed that there were none of Borrow&rsquo;s works in
the library of the school of which Borrow had been the most
distinguished pupil.</p>
<p>From that time&mdash;in 1881&mdash;until 1899, a period of
eighteen years, Borrow had but little biographical
recognition.&nbsp; A few introductions to his books, sundry
encyclopaedia articles, and one or two magazine essays made up
the sum total of information concerning the author of
<i>Lavengro</i> until Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s <i>Life</i> appeared in
1899.&nbsp; That <i>Life</i> has been severely handled by some
lovers of Borrow, and lovers of Borrow are now plentiful
enough.&nbsp; Dr. Knapp had not the cunning of the really
successful biographer.&nbsp; His book still remains in the huge
two-volumed form in which it was first issued four years ago, and
I do not anticipate that it will ever be a popular book.&nbsp;
There is no literary art in it.&nbsp; There is a capacity for
amassing facts, but no power of co-ordinating these facts.&nbsp;
Moreover Dr. Knapp did a great deal of mischief by very
over-zeal.&nbsp; He made too great a research into all the
current gossip in Norfolk and Suffolk concerning Borrow.&nbsp;
<!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>If you were to make special research into the life of
any friend or acquaintance of the past you would hear much
foolish gossip and a great many wrong motives imputed, and
possibly you would not have an opportunity of checking the
various statements.&nbsp; The whole of Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s book
seems to be written upon the principle of &ldquo;I would if I
could&rdquo; say a good many things, and, indeed, every few
months there appears in the <i>Eastern Daily Press</i>, a journal
of your city that I have read every day regularly since boyhood,
a letter from some one explaining that the less inquiry about
this or that point in Borrow&rsquo;s career the better for
Borrow.&nbsp; Take, for example, last Saturday&rsquo;s issue of
the journal I have named, where I find the following from a
correspondent:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Knapp, from dictates of courtesy, left it
unrevealed, and as he could say nothing to Borrow&rsquo;s credit,
passed the affair over in silence, and on this point all
well-wishers of Borrow&rsquo;s reputation would be wise to take
their cue from this biographer&rsquo;s example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now there is nothing more damnatory than a sentence of this
kind.&nbsp; What does it amount to?&nbsp; What is the
&lsquo;it&rsquo; that is unrevealed by the <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>courteous Dr.
Knapp?&nbsp; It seems to amount to the charge that Borrow is
accused of gibbeting in his books the people he dislikes; this is
what every great imaginative writer has been charged with to the
perplexing of dull people.&nbsp; There are many characters in
Dickens&rsquo;s novels which are supposed to be a presentation of
near relatives or friends.&nbsp; These he ought to have treated
with more kindliness.&nbsp; That heroic little woman, Miss
Bront&euml;, gave a picture of Madame H&eacute;ger, who kept a
school at Brussels, that conveyed, I doubt not, a very mistaken
presentation of the subject of her satire.&nbsp; Imaginative
writers have always taken these liberties.&nbsp; When the worst
is said it simply amounts to this, that Borrow was a good
hater.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson said that he loved a good hater, and he
might very well have loved Borrow.&nbsp; Dante, whom we all now
agree to idolize, treated people even more roughly; he placed
some of his acquaintances who had ill-used him in the very lowest
circles of hell.&nbsp; May I express a hope, therefore, that this
type of letter to the Norwich newspapers about Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s
&ldquo;kindness&rdquo; to Borrow&rsquo;s reputation may
cease.&nbsp; If Dr. Knapp <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>had printed
the whole of the facts we should know how to deal with them; but
this is one of his limitations as a biographer.&nbsp; He has not
in the least helped to a determination of Borrow&rsquo;s real
character.</p>
<p>Had Borrow possessed a biographer so skilful with her pen as
Mrs. Gaskell in her <i>Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;</i>, so
keen-eyed for the dramatic note as Sir George Trevelyan in his
<i>Life of Macaulay</i>, he would have multiplied readers for
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; There are many people who have read the
Bront&euml; novels from sheer sympathy with the writers that
their biographer, Mrs. Gaskell, had kindled.&nbsp; Let us not,
however, be ungrateful to Dr. Knapp.&nbsp; He has furnished those
of us who are sufficiently interested in the subject with a fine
collection of documents.&nbsp; Here is all the material of
biography in its crude state, but presenting vividly enough the
live Borrow to those who have the perception to read it with care
and judgment.&nbsp; Still more grateful may we be to Dr. Knapp
for his edition of Borrow&rsquo;s works, particularly for those
wonderful episodes in <i>Lavengro</i> which he has reproduced
from the original manuscript, episodes as dramatic as any other
portion of the <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>text, and making Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s
edition of <i>Lavengro</i> the only possible one to possess.</p>
<p>But to return to the main facts of Borrow&rsquo;s career,
which every one here at least is familiar with.&nbsp; You know of
his birth at East Dereham, of his life in Ireland and in
Scotland, of his school days at Norwich, of his departure from
Norwich to London on his father&rsquo;s death, of his dire
struggles in the literary whirlpool, and of his wanderings in
gipsy land.&nbsp; You know, thanks to Dr. Knapp, more than you
could otherwise have learned of his life at St. Petersburg,
whither he had been sent by the Bible Society, on the
recommendation of Mr. Joseph John Gurney and another
patron.&nbsp; Then he has himself told us in picturesque fashion
of his life in Portugal and Spain.&nbsp; After this we hear of
his marriage to Mary Clarke, his residence from 1840 to 1853 at
Oulton, in Suffolk, from 1853 to 1860 at Yarmouth, from 1860 to
1874 in Hereford Square, London, and finally from 1874 to 1881 at
Oulton, where he died.&nbsp; That is the bare skeleton of
Borrow&rsquo;s life, and for half his life, I think, we should be
content with a skeleton.&nbsp; For the other half of it we have
the best autobiography <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>in the English language.&nbsp; An
autobiography that ranks with Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Truth and Poetry
from my Life</i> and Rousseau&rsquo;s <i>Confessions</i>.&nbsp;
In four books&mdash;in <i>Lavengro</i>, <i>Romany Rye</i>, <i>The
Bible in Spain</i>, and <i>Wild Wales</i> we have some delightful
glimpses of an interesting personality, and here we may leave the
personal side of Borrow.&nbsp; Beyond this we know that he was
unquestionably a devoted son, a good husband, a kind
father.&nbsp; The literary life has its perils, so far as
domesticity is concerned.&nbsp; Sir Walter Scott in his life of
Dryden speaks of:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Her who had to endure the apparently causeless
fluctuation of spirits incidental to one compelled to dwell for
long periods of time in the fitful realms of the imagination,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and it is certain that those who dwell in the realms of the
imagination are usually very irritable, very difficult to live
with.&nbsp; Literary history in its personal side is largely a
dismal narrative of the uncomfortable relations of men of genius
with their wives and with their families.&nbsp; Your man of
genius thinks himself bound to hang up his fiddle in his own
house, however merry a fellow he may prove himself to a hundred
boon companions outside.&nbsp; George Borrow was perhaps <!--
page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>the opposite of all this.&nbsp; As a companion and a
neighbour he did not always shine, if the impression of many a
witness is to be trusted.&nbsp; They tell anecdotes of his lack
of cordiality, of his unsociability, and so on.&nbsp; They have
told those anecdotes more industriously in Norwich than anywhere
else.&nbsp; He himself in an incomparable account of going to
church with the gypsies in <i>The Romany Rye</i> has the
following:</p>
<blockquote><p>It appeared as if I had fallen asleep in the pew
of the old church of pretty Dereham.&nbsp; I had occasionally
done so when a child, and had suddenly woke up.&nbsp; Yes,
surely, I had been asleep and had woke up; but no! if I had been
asleep I had been waking in my sleep, struggling, striving,
learning and unlearning in my sleep.&nbsp; Years had rolled away
whilst I had been asleep&mdash;ripe fruit had fallen, green fruit
had come on whilst I had been asleep&mdash;how circumstances had
altered, and above all myself whilst I had been asleep.&nbsp; No,
I had not been asleep in the old church!&nbsp; I was in a pew, it
is true, but not the pew of black leather, in which I sometimes
fell asleep in days of yore, but in a strange pew; and then my
companions, they were no longer those of days of yore.&nbsp; I
was no longer with my respectable father and mother, and my dear
brother, but with the gypsy cral and his wife, and the gigantic
Tawno, the Antinous of the dusky people.&nbsp; And what was I
myself?&nbsp; No longer an innocent child but a moody man,
bearing in my face, <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>as I knew well, the marks of my
strivings and strugglings; of what I had learnt and unlearnt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this &ldquo;moody man,&rdquo; let it be always remembered,
was a good husband and father.&nbsp; His wife was devoted to him,
his step-daughter carries now to an old age a profound reverence
and affection for his memory.&nbsp; Grieved beyond all words was
she&mdash;the Henrietta or &ldquo;Hen&rdquo; of all his
books&mdash;at what is maintained to be the utterly fictitious
narrative of Borrow&rsquo;s described deathbed that Professor
Knapp presented from the ill-considered gossip that he picked up
while staying in the neighbourhood. <a name="citation80"></a><a
href="#footnote80" class="citation">[80]</a>&nbsp; Borrow has
himself something to say concerning his family in <i>Wild
Wales</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Of my wife I will merely say that she is a perfect
paragon of wives&mdash;can make puddings and sweets and treacle
posset, and is the best woman of business in East Anglia: of my
step-daughter, for such she is though I generally call her
daughter, and with good reason seeing that she <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>has always
shown herself a daughter to me, that she has all kinds of good
qualities and several accomplishments, knowing something of
conchology, more of botany, drawing capitally in the Dutch style,
and playing remarkably well on the guitar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I am not quite sure but that Borrow was really a good
fellow all round, as well as being a good husband and
father.&nbsp; He hated the literary class, it is true.&nbsp; He
considered that the &ldquo;contemptible trade of author,&rdquo;
as he called it, was less creditable than that of a jockey.&nbsp;
He avoided as much as possible the writers of books, and
particularly the blue-stocking, and when they came in his way he
was not always very polite, sometimes much the reverse.&nbsp;
Only the other day a letter was published from the late Professor
Cowell describing a visit to Borrow and his not very friendly
reception.&nbsp; Well, Borrow was here as elsewhere a man of
insight.&nbsp; The literary class is usually a very narrow
class.&nbsp; It can talk about no trade but its own.&nbsp; Things
have grown worse since Borrow&rsquo;s day, I am sure, but they
were bad enough then.&nbsp; Borrow was a man of very varied
tastes.&nbsp; He took interest in gypsies and horses and prize
fighters and a hundred other entertaining <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>matters, and
so he despised the literary class, which cared for none of these
things.&nbsp; But unhappily for his fame the literary class has
had the final word; it has revealed all the gossip of a gossiping
peasantry, and it has done its best to present the recluse of
Oulton in a disagreeable light.&nbsp; Fortunately for Borrow, who
kept the bores at bay and contented himself with but few friends,
there were at least two who survived him to bear testimony to the
effect that he was &ldquo;a singularly steadfast and loyal
friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of these was Mr. Watts-Dunton, who tells
us in one of his essays that:</p>
<blockquote><p>George Borrow was a good man, a most winsome and a
most charming companion, an English gentleman, straightforward,
honest, and brave as the very best examplars of that fine old
type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have dwelt longer on this aspect of my subject than I should
have done had I been addressing any other audience than a Norwich
one.&nbsp; But the fact is that all the gossip and backbiting and
censoriousness that has gathered round Borrow for a hundred years
has come out of this very city, commencing with the &ldquo;bursts
of laughter&rdquo; that, according to Miss Martineau, greeted
Borrow&rsquo;s <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>travels in Spain for the Bible
Society.&nbsp; Borrow was twenty-one years of age when he left
Norwich to make his way in the world.&nbsp; During the next
twenty years he may have undergone many changes of intellectual
view, as most of us do, as Miss Martineau notably did, and Miss
Martineau and her laughing friends were diabolically
uncharitable.&nbsp; That lack of charity followed Borrow
throughout his life.&nbsp; He was libelled by many, by Miss
Frances Power Cobbe most of all.&nbsp; However, the great city of
Norwich will make up for it in the future, and she will love
Borrow as Borrow indisputably loved her.&nbsp; How he praised her
fine cathedral, her lordly castle, her Mousehold Heath, her
meadows in which he once saw a prize fight, her pleasant
scenery&mdash;no city, not even glorious Oxford, has been so well
and adequately praised, and I desire to show that that praise is
not for an age but for all time.</p>
<p>If George Borrow has not been happy in his biographer, and if,
as is true, he has received but inadequate treatment on this
account&mdash;such series of little books as <i>The English Men
of Letters</i> and the <i>Great Writers</i> quite ignoring <!--
page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>him&mdash;he has been equally unfortunate in his
critics.&nbsp; There are hardly any good and distinctive
appreciations in print of Borrow&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; While other
great names in the great literature of the Victorian Period have
been praised by a hundred pens, there has scarcely been any
notable and worthy praise of Borrow, and if I were in an audience
that was at all sceptical as to Borrow&rsquo;s supreme merits,
which happily I am not; if I were among those who declared that
they could see but small merit in Borrow themselves, but were
prepared to accept him if only I could bring good authority that
he was a very great writer, I should be hardly put to to comply
with the demand.&nbsp; I can only name Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton
and Mr. Augustine Birrell as critics of considerable status who
have praised Borrow well.&nbsp; &ldquo;The delightful, the
bewitching, the never sufficiently-to-be-praised George
Borrow,&rdquo; says Mr. Birrell in one of the essays he has
written on the subject; <a name="citation84"></a><a
href="#footnote84" class="citation">[84]</a> while Mr. Theodore
<!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>Watts-Dunton, has written no less than four papers on
one whom he knew and admires personally, and of whom he insists
that &ldquo;his idealizing powers, his romantic cast of mind, his
force, his originality, give him a title to a permanent place
high in the ranks of English prose writers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this is very interesting, but in literature as in life we
have got to work out our own destinies.&nbsp; <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>We have not
got to accept Borrow because this or that critic tells us he is
good.&nbsp; I have therefore no quarrel with any one present who
does not share my view that Borrow was one of the greater glories
of English literature.&nbsp; I only desire to state my case for
him.</p>
<p>To be a lover of Borrow, a Borrovian, in fact, it is not
necessary to know all his books.&nbsp; You may never have seen
copies of the <i>Romantic Ballads</i> or of <i>Faustus</i>, of
<i>Targum</i> or of <i>The Turkish Jester</i>, of Borrow&rsquo;s
translation of <i>The Talisman</i> of Pushkin.&nbsp; Your state
may be none the less gracious.&nbsp; To possess these books is
largely a collector&rsquo;s hobby.&nbsp; They are interesting,
but they would not have made for the author an undying
reputation.&nbsp; Further, you may not care for <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>, you may be untouched by the <i>Gypsies in Spain</i>
and <i>Wild Wales</i>, and even then I will not deny to you the
title of a good Borrovian, if only you pronounce <i>Lavengro</i>
and <i>The Romany Rye</i> to be among the greatest books you
know.&nbsp; I can admire the <i>Gypsies in Spain</i> and <i>Wild
Wales</i>.&nbsp; I can read <i>The Bible in Spain</i> with
something of the enthusiasm with which our fathers read it.&nbsp;
It is a stirring narrative of <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>travel and
much more.&nbsp; Robert Louis Stevenson did, indeed, rank it
among his &ldquo;dear acquaintances&rdquo; in bookland,
&ldquo;the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> in the first rank,
<i>The Bible in Spain</i> not far behind,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;
All the same, it has not, none of these three books has, the
distinctive mark of first class genius that belongs to the other
two in the five-volumed edition of Borrow&rsquo;s Collected Works
that many of us have read through more than once.&nbsp; Not all
clever people have thought <i>Lavengro</i> and <i>The Romany
Rye</i> to be thus great.&nbsp; A critic in the <i>Athenaeum</i>
declared <i>Lavengro</i> when it was published in 1851 to be
&ldquo;balderdash,&rdquo; while a critic writing just fifty years
afterwards and writing from Norfolk, alas! insisted that the
author of this book &ldquo;was absolutely wanting in the power of
invention&rdquo; that he (Borrow) could &ldquo;only have drawn
upon his memory,&rdquo; that he had &ldquo;no sense of
humour.&rdquo;&nbsp; If all this were true, if half of it were
true, Borrow was not the great man, the great writer that I take
him to be.&nbsp; But it is not true.&nbsp; <i>Lavengro</i> with
its continuation <i>The Romany Rye</i>, is a great work of
imagination, of invention; it is in no sense a photograph, a
memory picture, and it abounds <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>in humour as
it abounds in many other great characteristics.&nbsp; What makes
an author supremely great?&nbsp; Surely a certain quality which
we call genius, as distinct from the mere intellectual power of
some less brilliant writer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>True genius is the ray that flings<br />
A novel light o&rsquo;er common things</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and here it is that Borrow shines supreme.&nbsp; He has
invested with quite novel light a hundred commonplace aspects of
life.&nbsp; Not an inventor! not imaginative!&nbsp; Why, one of
the indictments against him is that philologists decry his
philology and gyptologists his gypsy learning.&nbsp; If, then,
his philology and his gypsy lore were imperfect, as I believe
they were, how much the greater an imaginative writer he
was.&nbsp; To say that <i>Lavengro</i> merely indicates keen
observation is absurd.&nbsp; Not the keenest observation will
crowd so many adventures, adventures as fresh and as novel as
those of Gil Blas or Robinson Crusoe, into a few months&rsquo;
experience.&nbsp; &ldquo;I felt some desire,&rdquo; says
Lavengro, &ldquo;to meet with one of those adventures which upon
the roads of England are generally as plentiful as blackberries
in autumn.&rdquo;&nbsp; I <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>think that
most of us will wander along the roads of England for a very long
time before we meet an Isopel Berners, before we have such an
adventure as that of the blacksmith and his horse, or of the
apple woman whose favourite reading was <i>Moll
Flanders</i>.&nbsp; These and a hundred other adventures, the
fight with the Flaming Tinman, the poisoning of Lavengro by the
gypsy woman, the discourse with Ursula under the hedge, when once
read are fixed upon the memory for ever.&nbsp; And yet you may
turn to them again and again, and with ever increasing
zest.&nbsp; The story of Isopel Berners is a piece of imaginative
writing that certainly has no superior in the literature of the
last century.&nbsp; It was assuredly no photographic
experience.&nbsp; Isopel Berners is herself a creation ranking
among the fine creations of womanhood of the finest
writers.&nbsp; I doubt not but that it was inspired by some
actual memory of Borrow&mdash;the memory of some early love
affair in which the distractions of his mania for
word-learning&mdash;the Armenian and other languages&mdash;led
him to pass by some opportunity of his life, losing the substance
for the shadow.&nbsp; But whether there were ever a real Isopel
we shall <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>never know.&nbsp; We do know that
Borrow has presented his fictitious one with infinite poetry and
fine imaginative power.&nbsp; We do know, moreover, that it is
not right to describe Isopel Berners as a marvellous episode in a
narrative of other texture.&nbsp; <i>Lavengro</i> is full of
marvellous episodes.&nbsp; Some one has ventured to comment upon
Borrow&rsquo;s style&mdash;to imply that it is not always on a
high plane.&nbsp; What does that matter?&nbsp; Style is not the
quality that makes a book live, but the novelty of the
ideas.&nbsp; Stevenson was a splendid stylist, and his admirers
have deluded themselves into believing that he was, therefore,
among the immortals.&nbsp; But Stevenson had nothing new to tell
the world, and he was not, he is not, therefore of the
immortals.&nbsp; Borrow is of the immortals, not by virtue of a
style, but by virtue of having something new to say.&nbsp; He is
with Dickens and with Carlyle as one of the three great British
prose writers of the age we call Victorian, who in quite
different ways have presented a new note for their own time and
for long after.&nbsp; It is the distinction of Borrow that he has
invested the common life of the road, of the highway, the path
through the meadow, the gypsy encampment, <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>the country
fair, the very apple stall and wayside inn with an air of romance
that can never leave those of us who have once come under the
magnificent spell of <i>Lavengro</i> and the <i>Romany
Rye</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps Borrow is pre-eminently the writer for
those who sit in armchairs and dream of adventures they will
never undertake.&nbsp; Perhaps he will never be the favourite
author of the really adventurous spirit, who wants the real
thing, the latest book of actual travel.&nbsp; But to be the
favourite author of those who sit in arm-chairs is no small
thing, and, as I have said already, Borrow stands with Carlyle
and Dickens in <i>our</i> century, by which I mean the nineteenth
century; with Defoe and Goldsmith in the eighteenth century, as
one of the really great and imperishable masters of our
tongue.</p>
<p>What then will Norwich do for George Borrow?&nbsp; I ask this
question, although it would, perhaps, be an impertinence to ask
it were I not a Norwich man.&nbsp; If you have read Dr.
Knapp&rsquo;s <i>Life of Borrow</i>, you will have seen more than
one reference to Mrs. Borrow&rsquo;s landlord, &ldquo;old
King,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tom King the carpenter,&rdquo; and so on, who
owned the house in Willow Lane in which Borrow <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>spent his
boyhood.&nbsp; That &lsquo;old King the carpenter&rsquo;&mdash;I
believe he called himself a builder, but perhaps this was when he
grew more prosperous&mdash;was my great-great-uncle.&nbsp; One of
his sons became physician to Prince Talleyrand and married a
sister of John Stuart Mill.&nbsp; One of his great-nieces was my
grandmother, and her mother&rsquo;s family, the Parkers, had
lived in Norwich for many generations.&nbsp; So on the strength
of this little piece of genealogy let me claim, not only to be a
good Borrovian, but also a good Norvicensian.&nbsp; Grant me then
a right to plead for a practical recognition of Borrow in the
city that he loved most, although he sometimes scolded it as it
often scolded him.&nbsp; I should like to see a statue, or some
similar memorial.&nbsp; If you pass through the cities of the
Continent&mdash;French, German, or Belgian&mdash;you will find in
well-nigh every town a memorial to this or that worthy connected
with its literary or artistic fame.&nbsp; How many memorials has
Norwich to the people connected with its literary or artistic
fame?&nbsp; Nay, I am not rash and impetuous.&nbsp; I would beg
any one of my hearers who thinks that Borrow might well have <!--
page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>a memorial in marble or bronze in your city to wait a
while.&nbsp; You are busy with a statue to Sir Thomas
Browne&mdash;a most commendable scheme.&nbsp; To attempt to raise
one to Borrow at this moment would probably be to court
disaster.&nbsp; Nor do I advocate a memorial by private
subscription.&nbsp; Observation has shown me what that means:
failure or half failure in nearly every case.&nbsp; The memorial
when it comes must be initiated by the City Fathers in council
assembled.&nbsp; That time is perhaps far distant.&nbsp; But let
us all do everything we can to make secure the high and
honourable achievement of George Borrow, to kindle an interest in
him and his writings, to extend a taste for the undoubted
beauties of his works among all classes of his
fellow-citizens&mdash;that is to secure Borrow the best of all
monuments.&nbsp; More durable than brass will be the memorial
that is contained in the assurance that he possesses the
reverence and the homage of all true Norfolk hearts.</p>
<h2><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>IV.&nbsp; TO THE IMMORTAL MEMORY OF GEORGE CRABBE</h2>
<p>An Address delivered at the Crabbe Celebration at Aldeburgh in
Suffolk on the 16th of September, 1905.</p>
<p>I have been asked to say something in praise of George
Crabbe.&nbsp; The task would be an easier one were it not for the
presence of the distinguished critic from the University of Nancy
who is with us to-day.&nbsp; M. Huchon <a
name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97"
class="citation">[97]</a> has devoted to the subject a
singleminded zeal to which one whose profession is primarily that
of a journalist can make no claim.&nbsp; Moreover it has been
well said that <i>the judgment of foreigners is the judgment of
posterity</i>, and I fully believe that where a writer has
secured the suffrages of men of another nation than his own, he
has done more for his ultimate fame than the <!-- page 98--><a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>passing and
fickle favour of his countrymen can secure for him.&nbsp; In any
case Crabbe has been praised more eloquently than almost any
other modern, and this in spite of the fact that he was not read
by the generation succeeding his death, nor is he read much in
our own time.</p>
<p>If you want to read Crabbe to-day in his entirety, you must
become possessed of a huge and clumsy volume of sombre
appearance, small type and repellant double columns.&nbsp; For
fully seventy years it has not paid a publisher to reprint
Crabbe&rsquo;s poems properly. <a name="citation98"></a><a
href="#footnote98" class="citation">[98]</a>&nbsp; When this was
achieved in 1834, the edition in eight volumes was comparatively
a failure, and the promised two volumes of essays and sermons
were not forthcoming in consequence.&nbsp; Selections from Crabbe
have been many, but when all is said he has been the least read
for the past sixty or seventy years of all the authors who have
claims to be considered classics.&nbsp; The least read but
perhaps the best praised&mdash;that is one point of
certainty.&nbsp; The praise began <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>with the
politicians&mdash;with the two greatest political leaders of
their age.&nbsp; The eloquent and noble Edmund Burke, the
great-hearted Charles James Fox.&nbsp; Burke &ldquo;made&rdquo;
George Crabbe as no poet was ever made before or since.&nbsp; To
me there is no picture in all literature more unflaggingly
interesting than that of the great man, whose life was so full of
affairs, taking the poor young stranger by the hand, reading
through his abundant manuscripts, and therefrom
selecting&mdash;as the poet was quite unable to
select&mdash;<i>The Library</i> and <i>The Village</i> as the
most suitable for publication, helping him to a publisher,
introducing him to friends, and proving himself quite untiring on
his behalf.&nbsp; There is a letter of Burke&rsquo;s printed in a
little known book&mdash;<i>The Correspondence of Sir Thomas
Hanmer</i>, Speaker of the House of Commons&mdash;in which Burke
takes the trouble to defend Crabbe&rsquo;s moral character and to
press his claims for being admitted to holy orders.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dudley North tells me,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;that he
has the best character possible among those with whom he has
always lived, that he is now working hard to qualify, and has not
only Latin, but some smattering of Greek.&rdquo;&nbsp; It had
<!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>its gracious amenities, that eighteenth century, for I
do not believe that there is a man in the ranks of the present
Government, or of the present Opposition, who would take all this
trouble for a poor unknown who had appealed to him merely by two
or three long letters recounting his career.&nbsp; Nay, Cabinet
Ministers are less punctilious than formerly, and the newest
type, I understand, leaves letters unanswered.&nbsp; I can
imagine the attitude of one of our modern statesmen in the face
of two quite bulky packages of many sheets from a young
author.&nbsp; He would request his secretary to see what they
were all about, and then would follow the curt
answer&mdash;&ldquo;I am directed by Dash to say that he cannot
comply with your request.&rdquo;&nbsp; Burke not only wrote to
the Speaker of the House of Commons, but enclosed Crabbe&rsquo;s
letter to him, a quite wonderful piece of autobiography. <a
name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100"
class="citation">[100]</a>&nbsp; All Crabbe&rsquo;s admirers
should read that letter.&nbsp; Crabbe apologizes for writing
again, and refers to &ldquo;these repeated attacks on your
patience.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;had a place in the
Custom House at Aldeburgh.&nbsp; He had a large family, a little
income and no economy,&rdquo; and then the story of his life up
to that time is told to Burke in fullest detail.</p>
<p>Again, there is that other statesman-admirer of Crabbe,
Charles James Fox.&nbsp; Fox gave to Crabbe&rsquo;s work an
admiration which never faltered, and on his death-bed requested
that the pathetic story of Ph&oelig;be Dawson in <i>The Parish
Register</i> should be read to him&mdash;it was, we are told,
&ldquo;the last piece of poetry that soothed his dying
ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Lord Holland&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs of the Whig Party</i> there
is a statement by his nephew which no biographer so far has
quoted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I read over to him the whole of Crabbe&rsquo;s
<i>Parish Register</i> in manuscript.&nbsp; Some parts he made me
read twice; he remarked several passages as exquisitely
beautiful, and objected to some few which I mentioned to the
author and which he, in almost every instance, altered before
publication.&nbsp; Mr. Fox repeated once or twice that it was a
very pretty poem, that Crabbe&rsquo;s condition in the world had
improved since he wrote <i>The Village</i>, and his view of life,
likewise <i>The Parish Register</i>, bore marks of considerably
more indulgence to our species; though not so many as he could
have wished, especially <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>as the few
touches of that nature were beautiful in the extreme.&nbsp; He
was particularly struck with the description of the substantial
happiness of a farmer&rsquo;s wife.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From great novelists the tributes are not less noteworthy than
from great statesmen.&nbsp; Jane Austen, whose personality
perhaps has more real womanly attractiveness than that of any
sister novelist of the first rank, declared playfully that if she
could have been persuaded to change her state it would have been
to become Mrs. Crabbe; and who can forget Sir Walter
Scott&rsquo;s request in his last illness: &ldquo;Read me some
amusing thing&mdash;read me a bit of Crabbe.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
read to him from <i>The Borough</i>, and we all remember his
comment, &ldquo;Capital&mdash;excellent&mdash;very
good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet at this time&mdash;in 1832&mdash;any
popularity that Crabbe had once enjoyed was already on the
wane.&nbsp; Other idols had caught the popular taste, and from
that day to this there was to be no real revival of appreciation
for these poems.&nbsp; There were to be no lack of admirers,
however, of the audience &ldquo;fit though few.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Byron&rsquo;s praise has been too often quoted for
repetition.&nbsp; Wordsworth, who rarely praised his
contemporaries in poetry, declared of Crabbe that his works <!--
page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>&ldquo;would last from their combined merit as poetry
and truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Macaulay writes of &ldquo;that
incomparable passage in Crabbe&rsquo;s <i>Borough</i> which has
made many a rough and cynical reader cry like a
child&rdquo;&mdash;the passage in which the condemned felon</p>
<blockquote><p>Takes his tasteless food, and when &rsquo;tis
done,<br />
Counts up his meals, now lessen&rsquo;d by that one,&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a story which Macaulay bluntly charges Robert Montgomery with
stealing.&nbsp; Lord Tennyson, again, at a much later date,
admitted that &ldquo;Crabbe has a world of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not less impressive surely is the attitude of the two writers
as far as the poles asunder in their outlook upon life and its
mysteries&mdash;Cardinal Newman and Edward FitzGerald.&nbsp; The
famous theologian, we learn from the <i>Letters and
Correspondence</i> collected by Anne Mozley, writes in 1820 of
his &ldquo;excessive fondness&rdquo; for <i>The Tales of the
Hall</i>, and thirty years later in one of his <i>Discourses</i>
he says of Crabbe&rsquo;s poems that they are among &ldquo;the
most touching in our language.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still another twenty
years, and the aged cardinal reread Crabbe to find that he <!--
page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>was more delighted than ever with our poet.&nbsp; That
great nineteenth century pagan, on the other hand, that prince of
letter-writers and wonderful poet of whom Suffolk has also reason
to be proud, Edward FitzGerald, was even more ardent.&nbsp;
Praise of Crabbe is scattered freely throughout the many volumes
of his correspondence, and he edited, as we all know, a book of
Selections, which I want to see reprinted.&nbsp; It contains a
preface that, it may be admitted, is not really worthy of
FitzGerald, so lacking is it in the force and vigour of his
correspondence.&nbsp; But this also was in fact yet another
death-bed tribute, for it was, I think, one of the last things
FitzGerald wrote.&nbsp; FitzGerald, however, has done more for
Crabbe among the moderns than any other man.&nbsp; His keen
literary judgment must have brought new converts to that limited
brotherhood of the elect, of which this gathering forms no
inconsiderable portion.</p>
<p>We have one advantage in speaking about George Crabbe that
does not obtain with any other poet of great eminence; that is to
say, that his life story has not been hackneyed by
repetition.&nbsp; <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>With almost any other writer there
is some standing biography which is widely familiar.&nbsp; The
<i>Life of George Crabbe</i>, written by his son, although it is
one of the very best biographies that I have ever read, is little
known.&nbsp; It was quite out of print for years, and it has
never been reprinted separately from the poems.&nbsp; It is an
admirable biography, and it offers a contradiction of the view
occasionally urged that a man&rsquo;s life should not be written
by a member of his own family; for George Crabbe the second would
seem not only to have been an exceedingly able man, but possessed
of a frankness of disposition in criticizing his father which
sons are often prone to show in real life, but which, I imagine,
they rarely show in print.&nbsp; His book is a model of candid
statement, treating of Crabbe&rsquo;s little weaknesses&mdash;and
who of us has not his little weaknesses&mdash;in the most cheery
possible manner.&nbsp; It is perhaps a small matter to tell us in
one place of his father&rsquo;s want of &ldquo;taste,&rdquo; his
insensibility to the beauty of order in his
composition&mdash;that had been done by the critics before him;
but he even has something to say about the philandering which
characterized the old gentleman in the <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>last years
of his life, his apparent anxiety to get married again. <a
name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a>&nbsp; The only thing that he all but
ignores is Crabbe&rsquo;s opium habit&mdash;a habit that came to
him as a sedative from a painful complaint and inspired, as was
the case with Coleridge, his more melodious utterances.&nbsp;
Taken altogether the picture is as pleasant as it is capable and
exhaustive.&nbsp; We see his early boyhood at Aldeburgh, his
schooldays: his first period of unhappiness at Slaughden Quay,
his apprenticeship near Bury St. Edmunds, where we seem to hear
his master&rsquo;s daughters, when he reached the door, exclaim
with laughter, &ldquo;La!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s our new
&rsquo;prentice.&rdquo;&nbsp; We follow him a little higher, to
the house of the Woodbridge surgeon, then through his prolonged
courtship of Sarah Elmy, then to those dreary, uncongenial duties
of piling up butter casks on Slaughden Quay.&nbsp; A brief period
of starvation in London, and we find him again in a
chemist&rsquo;s shop in Aldeburgh.&nbsp; Lastly comes his most
important journey to London upon the borrowed sum of &pound;5,
only three of which he <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>carried in
hard cash.&nbsp; His hand to mouth existence in London for some
months is among the most interesting things in literature.&nbsp;
Chatterton&rsquo;s tragic fate might have been his, but, more
fortunate than Chatterton, he had friends at Beccles who helped
him, and he was even able to publish a poem, <i>The
Candidate</i>.&nbsp; Although this poem contained only
thirty-four pages, one is not quite sure but that it helped to
ruin its publisher.&nbsp; In any case that publisher went
bankrupt soon after.</p>
<p>Crabbe has been reproached for having continually attempted to
secure a &ldquo;patron&rdquo; at this time, and it has been
hinted by Sir Leslie Stephen that he ought to have recognized
that the patron was out of date, killed by Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s
sturdy defiance.&nbsp; I do not agree with this view.&nbsp; Dr.
Johnson, in spite of his famous epigram, was always more or less
assisted by the patron, although his personality was strong
enough to enable him to turn the tables at the end.&nbsp; When
one comes to think of it, Thrale the brewer was a patron of
Johnson, so was Strahan the printer.&nbsp; And does he not say in
his famous letter to Lord Chesterfield that &ldquo;Seven years,
my <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>lord, have now passed since I waited in your outward
rooms, or was repulsed from your door,&rdquo; clearly implying
that if Chesterfield was not Johnson&rsquo;s patron it was not
the great Doctor&rsquo;s fault?&nbsp; In any case the patron must
always exist for the poor man of letters in every age.&nbsp; Now,
he is frequently a collective personality rather than an
individual.&nbsp; He is represented for the author who has tried
and failed by the Royal Literary Fund, by such bounty as is
awarded by the Society of Authors, or by the Civil List
Grant.&nbsp; For the author in embryo he is assisted above all by
the literary log-roller who flourishes so much in our day.&nbsp;
If he is not this &ldquo;collective personality,&rdquo; or one of
the others I have named, then he is something much
worse&mdash;that is, a capitalist publisher.&nbsp; We can none of
us who have to earn a living run away from the patronage of
capital, and when Sir Leslie Stephen was being paid a salary by
the late Mr. George Smith for editing the <i>Dictionary of
National Biography</i>, and was told, as we remember that he
frequently was, that it was not a remunerative venture and that,
as Mr. Smith was fond of saying, his publishing business did not
pay for his vineries, Sir <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>Leslie
Stephen was experiencing a patronage, if he had known it, not
less melancholy than anything Crabbe suffered from Edmund Burke
or the Duke of Rutland.</p>
<p>When one meets a writer who desires to walk on high stilts and
to talk of the independence of literature, one is entitled to ask
him if it was a greater indignity for Lord Tennyson in his
younger days to have received &pound;200 a year from the Civil
List than for Crabbe to have received the same sum as the Duke of
Rutland&rsquo;s chaplain; in fact, Crabbe earned the money, and
Tennyson did not.&nbsp; There are, as I have said, some most
wonderful and pathetic touches in the account of Crabbe&rsquo;s
attempt to conquer London.&nbsp; There are his letters to his
sweetheart, for example, his &ldquo;dearest Mira,&rdquo; in one
of which he says that he is possessed of 6&frac14;<i>d.</i> in
the world.&nbsp; In another he relates that he has sold his
surgical instruments in order to pay his bills.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, we find him standing at a bookstall where he sees
Dryden&rsquo;s works in three volumes, octavo, for five
shillings, and of his few shillings he ventures to offer
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&mdash;and carries home the Dryden.&nbsp;
What bibliophile but <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>must love such a story as that, even
though a day or two afterwards its hero writes, &ldquo;My last
shilling became 8<i>d.</i> yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; But what a
good investment withal.&nbsp; Dryden made him a much better
poet.&nbsp; Then comes the famous letter to Burke, and the less
known second letter to which I have referred, and Burke&rsquo;s
splendid reception of the writer.&nbsp; Nothing, I repeat, in the
life of any great man is more beautiful than that.&nbsp; As
Crabbe&rsquo;s son finely says: &ldquo;He went in Burke&rsquo;s
room a poor young adventurer, spurned by the opulent and rejected
by the publishers, his last shilling gone, and his last hope with
it.&nbsp; He came out virtually secure of almost all the good
fortune that by successive stages afterwards fell to his
lot.&rdquo;&nbsp; The success that comes to most men is built up
on such chances, on the kind help of some one or other
individual.</p>
<p>Finally there came&mdash;for I am hastily recapitulating
Crabbe&rsquo;s story&mdash;the years of prosperity, curacies,
rectories, the praise of great contemporaries, but nothing surely
more edifying than the burning of piles of manuscripts so
extensive that no fireplace would hold them.&nbsp; The
son&rsquo;s account of his assisting at these conflagrations is
<!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>not the least interesting part of his biography, the
merits of which I desire to emphasize.</p>
<p>People who make jokes about that most succulent edible, the
crab, when the poet Crabbe is mentioned in their
presence&mdash;and who can resist an obvious pun&mdash;are not
really far astray.&nbsp; There can be little doubt but that a
remote ancestor of George Crabbe took his name from the
&ldquo;shellfish,&rdquo; as we all persist, in spite of the
naturalist, in calling it; and the poet did not hesitate to
attribute it to the vanity of an ancestor that his name had had
two letters added.&nbsp; Nor when we hear of Cromer crabs, or
crabs from some other part of Norfolk as distinct from what I am
sure is equally palatable, the crustacean as it may be found in
Aldeburgh, are we remote from the story of our poet&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; For there cannot be a doubt but that Norfolk shares
with Suffolk the glory of his origin.&nbsp; His family, it is
clear, came first from Norfolk.&nbsp; The Crabbes of Norfolk were
farmers, the Crabbes of Suffolk always favoured the seacoast, and
all the glory that surrounds the name of the poet to whom we do
honour to-day is reflected in the town in which he was born and
bred.&nbsp; Aldeburgh is Crabbe&rsquo;s <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>own town,
and it is an interesting fact that no other poet can be
identified with one particular spot in the way in which Crabbe
can be identified with this beautiful watering-place in which we
are now assembled.&nbsp; Shakspere was more of a Londoner than a
Stratfordian; nearly all his best work was written in London, and
many of the most receptive years of his life were spent in that
city.&nbsp; Milton&rsquo;s honoured name is identified with many
places, apart from London, the city of his birth.&nbsp; Shelley,
Byron and Keats were essentially cosmopolitans in their writings
as in their lives.&nbsp; Wordsworth was closely identified with
Grasmere, although born in a neighbouring county; but he went to
many and varied scenes, and to more than one country, for some of
his most inspired verses.&nbsp; Then Cowper, the poet of whom one
most often thinks when one is recalling the achievement of
Crabbe, is a poet of some half-dozen places other than Olney, and
perhaps his best verses were written at Weston-Underwood.&nbsp;
Now George Crabbe in the years of his success was identified with
many places other than Aldeburgh: with Belvoir Castle, with
Muston, and with Trowbridge, where he died, <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>and some of
his admirers have even identified him with Bath.&nbsp; When all
this is allowed, it is upon Aldeburgh that the whole of his
writings turned, the place where he was born, where he spent his
boyhood, and the earlier years of a perhaps too sordid manhood,
whither he returned twice, as a chemist&rsquo;s assistant and as
curate.&nbsp; It is the place that primarily inspired all his
verses.&nbsp; Aldeburgh stands out vividly before us in each
succeeding poem&mdash;in <i>The Village</i>, <i>The Borough</i>,
<i>The Parish Register</i>, <i>The Tales</i>, and even in those
<i>Tales of the Hall</i>, composed in later life in faraway
Trowbridge.&nbsp; Crabbe&rsquo;s vivid observations indeed come
home to every one who has studied his works when they have
visited not only Aldeburgh but its vicinity.&nbsp; Every reach of
the river Ald recalls some striking line by him: the scenery in
<i>The Lover&rsquo;s Journey</i> we know is a description of the
road between Aldeburgh and Beccles, and all who have sailed along
the river to Orford have recognized that no stream has been so
perfectly portrayed by a poet&rsquo;s pen.&nbsp; Here in his
writings you may have a suggestion of Muston, here of Allington,
and here again of Trowbridge; but in the main it is the Suffolk
scenery that most <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>of us here know so well that was
ever in his mind.</p>
<p>When an attempt was once made to stir up the Great Eastern
Railway to identify this district with the name of Crabbe as the
English Lakes were identified with the name of Wordsworth, and
the Scots Lakes with that of Sir Walter Scott, a high official of
the railway made the statement that up to that moment he had
never even heard the name of Crabbe.&nbsp; Well, all that is
going to be changed.&nbsp; I do not at all approve of the phrase
beloved of certain book-makers and of railway companies that
implies that any county or district is the monopoly of one man,
be he ever so great a writer.&nbsp; Yet I venture to say that
within the next ten years the &ldquo;Crabbe Country&rdquo; will
sound as familiar to the officials of the Great Eastern as the
&ldquo;Wordsworth Country&rdquo; does to those of the Midland or
the North Western.&nbsp; It is true that once in the bitterness
of his heart the poet referred to Aldeburgh as &ldquo;a little
venal borough in Suffolk&rdquo; and that he more than once
alluded to his unkind reception upon his reappearance as a
curate, when he had <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>previously failed at other
callings.&nbsp; &ldquo;In my own village they think nothing of
me,&rdquo; he once said.&nbsp; But who does not know how the
heart turns with the years to the places associated with
childhood and youth, and Crabbe was a remarkable exemplification
of this.&nbsp; A well-known literary journal stated only last
week that &ldquo;Crabbe&rsquo;s connexion with Aldeburgh was not
very protracted.&rdquo;&nbsp; So far from this being true it
would be no exaggeration to say that it extended over the whole
of his seventy-eight years of life.&nbsp; It included the first
five-and-twenty years almost entirely.&nbsp; It included also the
brief curacy, the prolonged residence at Parham and Glenham,
frequent visits for holidays in after years, and who but a lover
of his native place would have done as his son pictures him doing
when at Stathern&mdash;riding alone to the coast of Lincolnshire,
sixty miles from where he was living, only to dip in the waves
that also washed the beach of Aldeburgh and returned immediately
to his home.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no sea like the Aldeburgh
sea,&rdquo; said Edward FitzGerald, and we may be sure that was
Crabbe&rsquo;s opinion also, for revisiting it in later life he
wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>There once again, my native place I
come<br />
Thee to salute, my earliest, latest home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One picture in Crabbe&rsquo;s life stands out vividly to us
all&mdash;the long years of devotion given by him to Sarah Elmy,
and the reciprocal devotion of the very capable woman who finally
became his wife.&nbsp; Crabbe&rsquo;s courtship and marriage
affords a pleasant contrast to the usual unhappy relations of
poets with their wives.&nbsp; Shakspere, Milton, Dryden, Byron,
Shelley, and many another poet was less happy in this respect,
and I am not sure how far the belief in Crabbe&rsquo;s powers as
a poet has been affected by the fact that he lived on the whole a
happy, humdrum married life.&nbsp; The public has so long been
accustomed to expect a different state of things.</p>
<p>I have given thus much time to Crabbe&rsquo;s life story
because it interests me, and I do not believe that it is possible
nowadays to kindle a very profound interest in any writer without
a definite presentation of his personality.&nbsp; Apart from his
biography&mdash;his three biographies by George Crabbe the
second, Mr. T. E. Kebbel, and Canon Ainger, there are the seven
volumes of his works.&nbsp; Now I do not imagine that any great
accession will <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>be made to the ranks of
Crabbe&rsquo;s admirers by asking people to take down these seven
volumes and read them right through&mdash;a thing I have myself
done twice, and many here also I doubt not.&nbsp; Rather would I
plead for a reprint of Edmund FitzGerald&rsquo;s Selections, or
failing that I would ask you to look at the volume of Selections
made by Mr. Bernard Holland, or that other admirable selection by
the Rev. Anthony Deane.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must think my old Crabbe
will come up again, though never to be popular,&rdquo; wrote
FitzGerald to Archbishop Trench.&nbsp; Well, perhaps the
&ldquo;large still books&rdquo; of the older writers are never
destined to be popular again, but they will always maintain with
genuine book lovers their place in English Literature, and if the
adequate praise they have received from many good judges is well
kept to the front there will be constant accessions to the ranks,
and readers will want the whole of Crabbe&rsquo;s works in which
to dig for themselves.&nbsp; Crabbe&rsquo;s place in English
Literature needed not such a gathering as this to make it secure,
but we want celebrations of our literary heroes to keep alive
enthusiasm, and to encourage the faint-hearted.</p>
<p><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>In the glorious tradition of English Literature, then,
Crabbe comes after Cowper and before Wordsworth.&nbsp; There is a
lineal descent as clear and well-defined as any set forth in the
peerages of &ldquo;Burke&rdquo; or &ldquo;Debrett.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We read in vain if we do not fully grasp the continuity of
creative work.&nbsp; Cowper was born in 1731, Crabbe in 1754, and
Cowper was called to the Bar in the year that Crabbe was
born.&nbsp; In spite of this disparity of years they started upon
their literary careers almost at the same time.&nbsp; <i>The
Village</i> was published in 1783, and <i>The Task</i> in 1785,
yet Cowper is in every sense the elder poet, inheriting more
closely the traditions of Pope and Dryden, coming less near to
humanity than Crabbe, and being more emphatically a child of the
eighteenth century in its artificial aspects.&nbsp; It is
impossible to indict a whole century with all its varied
accomplishments, and the century that produced Swift and Cowper
and Crabbe had no lack of the finer instincts of
brotherhood.&nbsp; Yet the century was essentially a cruel
one.&nbsp; Take as an example the attitude of naturally kindly
men to the hanging of Dr. Dodd for forgery.&nbsp; Even Samuel
Johnson, who did <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>what he could for Dodd, did not
find, as he should have done, his whole soul revolted by such a
punishment for a crime against property.&nbsp; Cowper has immense
claim upon our regard.&nbsp; He is one of the truest of poets,
and one of the most interesting figures in all English
literature, although no small share of his one-time popularity
was due to his identification with Evangelicalism in
religion.&nbsp; Cowper had humour and other qualities which
enabled him to make the universal appeal to all hearts which is
the test of the greatest literature&mdash;the appeal of
&ldquo;John Gilpin,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Lines&rdquo; to his
Mother&rsquo;s Portrait, and his verses on &ldquo;The loss of the
<i>Royal George</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Crabbe made no such appeal, and
he has not the adventitious assistance that association with a
religious sect affords.&nbsp; Hence the popularity he once
enjoyed was more entirely on his merits than was that of
Cowper.&nbsp; He was the first of the eighteenth century poets
who was able to <i>see things as they really are</i>.&nbsp;
Therein lies his strength.&nbsp; Were they poets at
all&mdash;those earlier eighteenth century writers?&nbsp; It
sounds like rank blasphemy to question it, but what is
poetry?&nbsp; Surely it is the expression artistically in
rhythmic form&mdash;<!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>or even without it&mdash;of the
sincerest emotions concerning nature and life.&nbsp; The greatest
poet is not the one who is most sincere&mdash;a very bad poet can
be that&mdash;but the poet who expresses that sincerity with the
most perfect art.&nbsp; From this point of view the poets before
Cowper and Crabbe, Pope, Goldsmith, Johnson and others were
scarcely poets at all.&nbsp; Masters of language every one of
them, able to command a fine rhetoric, but not poets.&nbsp; Gray
in two or three pieces was a poet, but for Johnson that claim can
scarcely be made.&nbsp; Cowper was the first to emancipate
himself from the conventionality of his age, and Crabbe
emancipated himself still further.&nbsp; He had boundless
sincerity, and he is really a very great poet even if he has not
the perfection of art of some later poets.&nbsp; Many know Crabbe
only by the parody of his manner in <i>Rejected
Addresses</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>John Richard William Alexander Dwyer<br />
Was footman to Justinian Stubbs Esquire;<br />
But when John Dwyer listed in the blues,<br />
Emanuel Jennings polished Stubbs&rsquo;s shoes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and it must be admitted that there are plenty of lines like
these in Crabbe, as for example:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>Grave Jonas Kindred, Sybil
Kindred&rsquo;s sire<br />
Was six feet high, and looked six inches higher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The church he view&rsquo;d as liberal minds will
view<br />
And there he fixed his principles and pew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Banalities of this kind are scattered through his pages as
they are scattered through those of Wordsworth.&nbsp;
Nevertheless he was a great poet, bringing us before Wordsworth
out of the ruck of artificiality and insincerity.&nbsp; Does any
one suppose that Pope in his <i>Essay on Man</i>, that Johnson in
his <i>London</i> or that Goldsmith in his <i>Deserted
Village</i> had any idea other than the production of splendid
phrases.&nbsp; Each and all of them were brilliant men of
letters.&nbsp; Crabbe was not a brilliant man of letters, but he
was a fine and a genuine poet.&nbsp; You will look in vain in his
truest work for the lyrical and musical gift that we associate
with poets who came after:&mdash;Shelley, Keats,
Tennyson&mdash;poets who made Crabbe&rsquo;s work quite
distasteful for some three generations.&nbsp; Crabbe it has been
claimed had that gift also, to be found in &ldquo;Sir Eustace
Grey&rdquo; and other verses written under the inspiration of
opium, as much <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>of Coleridge&rsquo;s best work was
written&mdash;but it is not in these that his admirers will seek
to emphasize his achievement&mdash;it is in his work which treats
of</p>
<blockquote><p>The simple annals of my parish poor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Village</i>, <i>The Parish Register</i>, <i>The
Borough</i>, and many of the <i>Tales</i> bear witness to a clear
vision of life as it is lived by the majority of people born into
this world.&nbsp; I have seen criticism of Crabbe which calls him
the poet who took the middle classes for his subjects, criticism
which compared him with George Eliot.&nbsp; All this is quite
beside the mark.&nbsp; Crabbe is pre-eminently the poet of the
poor, with a lesson for to-day as much as for a century
ago.&nbsp; Villages are not now what they were then, we are
told.&nbsp; But I fully believe that there are all the conditions
of life to-day hidden beneath the surface as Crabbe&rsquo;s close
observations pictured them.&nbsp; &ldquo;The altered position of
the poor,&rdquo; says Mr. Courthope, &ldquo;has fortunately
deprived his poems of much of the reality they once
possessed.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not believe it.&nbsp; The closely
packed towns, the herding together of families, the squalor are
still to be found <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>in our midst.&nbsp; Crabbe has his
message for our time as well as for his own.&nbsp; How he tore
the veil from the conventional language of his day, the picture
of the ideal village where the happy peasantry passed through
life so joyously.&nbsp; Contrast such pictures with his sad
declaration&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve seldom known, though I have often
read<br />
Of happy peasants on their dying-bed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solution Crabbe offers none for the tragedy of poverty.&nbsp;
He was no politician.&nbsp; He signed the nomination paper for
John Wilson Croker the Tory in his native Aldeburgh, and he
supported a Whig at the same election at Trowbridge.&nbsp; His
politics were summed up in backing his friends of both
parties.&nbsp; But he did see, as politicians are only beginning
to see to-day, that the ultimate solution was a social one and
not a mere question of political parties.&nbsp; Generations have
passed away since he lived, and men are still shouting themselves
hoarse to prove that in this Shibboleth or in that may be found
the salvation of the country, yet we have still our thousands on
the verge of starvation, we have still the very poor in our
midst, and the problem seems as far from solution <!-- page
124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>as
ever.&nbsp; But it would be all the better for the State if we
could keep the questions raised by Crabbe in his wonderful
pictures more continually in view,&mdash;lacking in taste as they
may sometimes seem to weak stomachs, coarse, unvarnished
narratives though they be of a life which is really almost
entirely sordid.</p>
<p>Then let us turn to Crabbe&rsquo;s gallery of pictures.&nbsp;
Ph&oelig;be Dawson, and the equally pathetic Ruth, Blaney and
Clelia, Peter Grimes and many another.&nbsp; They are as clearly
defined a set of entirely human beings as any Master has given
us.&nbsp; It is not assuredly in George Eliot, as Canon Ainger
suggests, that I find an affinity to Crabbe among the moderns,
but in two much greater writers of quite different texture,
Balzac and Dickens.&nbsp; Had Crabbe not been bounded and
restrained by the conventions of his cloth, he might have become
one of the most popular story-tellers in our literature&mdash;the
English Balzac.&nbsp; At a hundred points Charles Dickens is an
entire contrast to Crabbe&mdash;in his buoyant humour, his gaiety
of heart, in the glamour that he throws over the life of the
poor, a glamour that was more present in the early Victorian <!--
page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>era than in our own, but Crabbe is with Balzac and with
Dickens in that he presents as no other moderns have done living
pictures of suffering human lives.</p>
<p>There is yet one other literary force, powerful in our day,
that has been largely influenced by Crabbe.&nbsp; Those who love
the novels of Mr. Thomas Hardy, whom we rejoice to see with us at
this Celebration,&mdash;his <i>Woodlanders</i>, <i>The Return of
the Native</i>, <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i>, and many
another book that touches the very heart of things in nature and
human life, will rejoice to hear that this great writer has
admitted George Crabbe to be the most potent influence that has
affected his work.&nbsp; I have heard him declare many times how
much he was inspired by Crabbe, whereas the later French realists
had no influence upon him whatever.&nbsp; &ldquo;Crabbe was our
first great English realist&rdquo; Mr. Hardy would tell you if
only we could persuade him to speak from this platform, as
unfortunately he will not.</p>
<p>Lastly let us take Crabbe as a great story-teller.&nbsp; He
has many more ideas than most of the novelists.&nbsp; That is why
we do well to recall the hint <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>of the
writer who said that when a new work came out we should take down
an old one from our shelves.&nbsp; Instead of the
&ldquo;un-idead&rdquo; novels, that come out by the dozen and are
so popular.&nbsp; I wish we could agree to read Crabbe&rsquo;s
novels in verse.&nbsp; Unhappily their form is against them in
the present age.&nbsp; But it would not be at all a misfortune if
we could make Crabbe&rsquo;s <i>Tales</i> once more the
vogue.&nbsp; They are good stories, absorbingly
interesting.&nbsp; They leave a very vivid impression on the
mind.&nbsp; Once read they are unforgettable.</p>
<p>I have seen it stated that these stories are old-fashioned
both in manner and in substance.&nbsp; In manner they may be, but
in substance I maintain they are intensely modern, alive with the
spirit of our time.&nbsp; Any latter-day novelist might envy
Crabbe his power of developing a story.&nbsp; It is this
essential modernity that is to make Crabbe&rsquo;s place in
English literature secure for generations yet to come.</p>
<p>Finally, Crabbe&rsquo;s place in English literature is as the
bridge between the eighteenth and nineteenth century.&nbsp; With
him begins that &ldquo;enthusiasm of humanity&rdquo; which the
eighteenth <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>century so imperfectly
understood.&nbsp; Byron and Wordsworth, disliking each other
cordially, did well to praise him, for he was their
forerunner.&nbsp; A master of pathos, you may find in his work
incentive to tears and laughter, although sometimes the humour,
as in <i>The Learned Boy</i>, is sadly unconscious.</p>
<p>But I must bring these rambling remarks to a close, and in
doing so I must once again quote that other Suffolk worthy to
whom many of us are very much attached, I mean Edward
FitzGerald.&nbsp; When Sir Leslie Stephen wrote what is to my
mind a singularly infelicitous essay on Crabbe in the
<i>Cornhill</i>, he quoted the remark, which seemed to be new to
FitzGerald, as to Crabbe being a &ldquo;pope in worsted
stockings&rdquo;&mdash;a remark made by Horace Smith of
<i>Rejected Addresses</i>, although I have seen it ascribed to
Byron and others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pope in worsted stockings,&rdquo;
exclaimed FitzGerald, &ldquo;why I could cite whole paragraphs of
as fine a texture as Moli&egrave;re; &lsquo;incapable of
epigram,&rsquo; the jackanapes says&mdash;why, I could find fifty
of the very best epigrams in five minutes,&rdquo; and later, in
another letter he writes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>I am positively looking over my
everlasting Crabbe again; he naturally comes in about the fall of
the year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here surely is an appropriate quotation, a little prophetic
perhaps, for our gathering&mdash;the &ldquo;everlasting
Crabbe.&rdquo;&nbsp; We cannot all love Crabbe as much as
FitzGerald loved him, but this gathering will not be vain if
after this we handle his volumes more lovingly, read his poems
more sympathetically, and continue with more zeal than ever
before to be proud of the man who, born in Aldeburgh a century
and a half ago, is closely identified with this county of Suffolk
as I believe no other great writer is closely identified with any
county in England.&nbsp; An Aldeburgh man&mdash;a Suffolk man he
was&mdash;yet even more in the future than in the past, he is
destined to gain the whole world for his parish.&nbsp; He is the
everlasting Crabbe!</p>

class="pagenum">p. 131</span>V.&nbsp; THE LITERARY ASSOCIATIONS
OF EAST ANGLIA</h2>
<p>An address to the East Anglian Society on the occasion of a
dinner to Mr. William Dutt, author of &ldquo;Highways and Byways
in East Anglia.&rdquo;&nbsp; March 25, 1901.</p>
<p>I appreciate the privilege of being allowed to speak this
evening for a few minutes upon the literary associations of East
Anglia, of being permitted to ask you, while doing honour to a
well-known East Anglian writer of to-day, to cast a glance back
upon the literature of the past so far as it affects that portion
of the British Empire with which we nearly all of us here are
proud to be associated.&nbsp; There is necessarily some
difference of opinion as to what constitutes East Anglia.&nbsp; I
find that our guest of to-night tells us that it is
&ldquo;Norfolk, Suffolk and portions of Essex, Cambridgeshire and
Lincolnshire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Knapp, the biographer of Borrow,
says that it is Norfolk, <!-- page 132--><a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Suffolk and
Cambridgeshire; personally I am content with that classification,
because, although I was born in London, I claim, apart from
schoolboy days at Downham Market, a pretty lengthy ancestry from
Norwich on one side&mdash;which is indisputably East
Anglia&mdash;and from Welney, near Wisbeach, on another side, and
Welney and Wisbeach are, I affirm, just as much East Anglia as
Norwich and Ipswich.&nbsp; With reference to those other counties
and portions of counties, I think that the inhabitants must be
allowed to decide for themselves.&nbsp; I imagine that they will
give every possible stretch to the imagination in order to allow
themselves the honour of being incorporated in East Anglia, a
name that one never pronounces without recalling that fine
old-world compliment of St. Augustine of Canterbury to our
ancestors, that they ought to be called not &ldquo;Angles&rdquo;
but &ldquo;Angels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every one in particular who loves books must be proud to
partake of our great literary tradition.&nbsp; If it is difficult
to decide precisely what East Anglia is, it is perhaps equally
difficult to speak for a few minutes on so colossal a theme as
the literature of East Anglia.&nbsp; It would be <!-- page
133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>easy to recapitulate what every biographical dictionary
will provide, a long list of famous names associated with our
counties; to remind you that we have produced two
poet-laureates&mdash;John Skelton, of Diss, the author of
<i>Colyn Cloute</i>, and Thomas Shadwell, of Broomhill, the
playwright&mdash;the latter perhaps not entirely a subject for
pride; two very rough and ready political philosophers, Thomas
Paine, born at Thetford, and William Godwin, born at Wisbeach; a
very popular novelist in Bulwer Lytton, and a very popular
theologian in Dr. Samuel Clarke; as also the famous brother and
sister whose works appealed to totally different minds, James and
Harriet Martineau.&nbsp; Then there was that pathetic creature
and indifferent poet, Robert Bloomfield, whose <i>Farmer&rsquo;s
Boy</i> once appeared in the luxurious glories of an expensive
quarto.&nbsp; Finally, one recalls that two of the most popular
women writers of an earlier generation, Clara Reeve, the
novelist, and Agnes Strickland, the historian, were Suffolk
women.</p>
<p>But I am not concerned to give you a recapitulation of all the
East Anglian writers, whose names, as I have said, can be found
in any biographical <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>dictionary, and the quality of whose
work would rather suggest that East Anglia, from a literary point
of view, is a land of extinct volcanoes.&nbsp; I am naturally
rather anxious to make use of the golden opportunity that has
been afforded me to emphasize my own literary sympathies, and to
say in what I think lies the glory of East Anglia, at least so
far as the creation of books is concerned.&nbsp; Here I make an
interesting claim for East Anglia, that it has given us in
Captain Marryat perhaps the very greatest prose writer of the
nineteenth century who has been a delight to youth, and two of
the very greatest prose writers of all times for the inspiration
of middle-age, Sir Thomas Browne and George Borrow.&nbsp; It has
given us in Sarah Austin an example of a learned woman who was
also a fascinating woman; it has given us again the most
remarkable letter-writers in the English language&mdash;Margaret
Paston, Horace Walpole and Edward FitzGerald.&nbsp; To these
there were only three serious rivals as
letter-writers&mdash;William Cowper, Thomas Grey and Charles
Lamb; and the first found a final home and a last resting-place
in our midst.&nbsp; It has given us that remarkable novelist and
entertaining diarist, <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>Fanny Burney.&nbsp; Finally, it has
given us in that same William Cowper&mdash;who rests in East
Dereham Church, and for whom we claim on that and for other
reasons some share and participation in his genius&mdash;a great
and much loved poet.&nbsp; It has given us indeed in William
Cowper and George Crabbe the two most natural and the two most
human poets in the English literature of two centuries, only
excepting the favourite poet of Scotland&mdash;Robert
Burns.&nbsp; It is to these of all writers that I would pin my
faith in talking of East Anglia and its literature; it is their
names that I would have you keep in your mind when you call up
memories of the literature which has most inspired our East
Anglian life.</p>
<p>In connexion with many writers a point of importance will
occur to us.&nbsp; Only occasionally has a great English author a
special claim on one particular portion of England.&nbsp; He has
not been the lesser or the greater for that, it has merely been
an accident of his birth and of his career.&nbsp; The greatest of
all writers, the one of whom all Englishmen are naturally the
most proud, Shakspere, has, it is true, an abundant association
with Warwickshire, but Shakspere stands almost alone <!-- page
136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>in
this, as in many things.&nbsp; Chaucer, Spenser, Milton, Byron
and Keats were born in London; they travelled widely, they lived
in many different counties or countries, and cannot be said to
have adorned any distinctively local tradition.&nbsp; Shelley was
born in Sussex, but a hundred cities, including Rome, where his
ashes rest, may claim some participation in his fine
spirit.&nbsp; Wordsworth, on the other hand, who was born in
Cumberland, certainly obtained the greater part of his
inspiration from the neighbouring county of Westmorland, where
his life was passed.&nbsp; But when we come to East Anglia we are
face to face with a body of writers who belong to the very soil,
upon whom the particular character of the landscape has had a
permanent effect, who are not only very great Englishmen and
Englishwomen, but are great East Anglians as well.</p>
<p>I have said that Captain Marryat was an East Anglian, and have
we not a right to be proud of Marryat&rsquo;s breezy stories of
the sea?&nbsp; Our youth has found such plentiful stimulus in
<i>Peter Simple</i>, <i>Frank Mildmay</i>, and <i>Mr. Midshipman
Easy</i>; generations of boys have read them with delight,
generations of boys will read them.&nbsp; And not <!-- page
137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>only boys, but men.&nbsp; One recalls that Carlyle, in
one of his deepest fits of depression, took refuge in
Marryat&rsquo;s novels with infinite advantage to his peace of
mind.&nbsp; Speaking of Captain Marryat and books for boys, a
quite minor kind of literature perhaps some of you may think, I
must recall that an earlier and still more famous story for
children had an East Anglian origin.&nbsp; Did not The Babes in
the Wood come out of Norfolk?&nbsp; Was it not their estate in
that county that, as we learn from Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques</i>,
their wicked uncle coveted, and were not the last hours of those
unfortunate children, in this most picturesque and pathetic of
stories, solaced by East Anglian robins and their poor bodies
covered by East Anglian vegetation?</p>
<p>Let me pass, however, to what may be counted more serious
literature.&nbsp; What can one say of Sir Thomas Browne unless
indeed one has an hour in which to say it.&nbsp; Every page of
that great writer&rsquo;s <i>Religio Medici</i> and <i>Urn
Burial</i> is quotable&mdash;full of worldly wisdom and of an
inspiration that is not of the world.&nbsp; Browne was born in
London, and not until he was thirty-two years of age did he
settle in Norwich, where he was <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>&ldquo;much
resorted to for his skill in physic,&rdquo; and where he lived
for forty-five years, when the fine church of St. Peter Mancroft,
received his ashes&mdash;a church in which, let me add, with
pardonable pride, my own grandfather and grandmother were
married.&nbsp; I am glad that Norwich is shortly to commemorate
by a fitting monument not the least great of her sons, one who
has been aptly called &ldquo;the English Montaigne.&rdquo; <a
name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138"
class="citation">[138]</a></p>
<p>Perhaps there are those who would dispute my claim for Marryat
and for Sir Thomas Browne that they were East Anglians&mdash;both
were only East Anglians by adoption.&nbsp; There are even those
who dispute the claim for one whom I must count well-nigh the
greatest of East Anglian men of letters&mdash;George
Borrow.&nbsp; Borrow, I maintain, was an East Anglian if ever
there was one, although this has been questioned by Mr. Theodore
Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; Now I have the greatest possible regard for
Mr. Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; He is distinguished alike as a critic, a
poet, and a romancer.&nbsp; But I must join issue <!-- page
139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>with him here, and you, I know, will forgive me for
taking up your time with the matter; for if Mr. Watts-Dunton were
right, one of the chief glories would be shorn from our East
Anglian traditions.&nbsp; He denies in the Introduction to a new
edition of <i>The Romany Rye</i>, just published, the claim of
Borrow to be an East Anglian, although Borrow himself insisted
that he was one.</p>
<blockquote><p>One might as well call Charlotte Bront&euml; a
Yorkshire woman as call Borrow an East Anglian.&nbsp; He was no
more an East Anglian than an Irishman born in London is an
Englishman.&nbsp; His father was a Cornishman and his mother of
French extraction.&nbsp; Not one drop of East Anglian blood was
in the veins of Borrow&rsquo;s father, and very little in the
veins of his mother.&nbsp; Borrow&rsquo;s ancestry was pure
Cornish on one side, and on the other mainly French.&nbsp; But
such was the egotism of Borrow that the fact of his having been
born in East Anglia made him look upon that part of the world as
the very hub of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I am not prepared to question the suggestion that East
Anglia is the hub of the universe, only to question Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s position.&nbsp; There is virtue in that
qualification of his that there was &ldquo;very little&rdquo;
East Anglian blood in the veins of Borrow&rsquo;s mother, and
that <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>she was &ldquo;mainly&rdquo;
French.&nbsp; As a matter of fact she was, of course, partly East
Anglian; that is to say, she must have had two or three
generations of East Anglian blood in her, seeing that it was her
great-grandfather who settled in Norfolk from France, and he and
his children and grandchildren intermarried with the race.&nbsp;
But I do not pin my claim for Borrow upon that fact&mdash;the
fact of three generations of his mother&rsquo;s family at
Dumpling Green&mdash;or even on the fact that he was born near
East Dereham.&nbsp; There is nothing more certain than that we
are all of us influenced greatly by our environment, and that it
is this, quite as much as birth or ancestry, that gives us what
characteristics we possess.&nbsp; It is the custom, for example,
to call Swift an Irishman, whereas Swift came of English
parentage and lived for many of his most impressionable years in
England.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he may be justly claimed by the
sister-island, for during a long sojourn in that country he
became permeated with the subtle influence of the Irish race, and
in many things he thought and felt as an Irishman.&nbsp; It is
the custom to speak of Maria Edgeworth as an Irish novelist, yet
Miss Edgeworth was born in <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>England of
English parentage.&nbsp; Nevertheless, she was quite as much an
Irish novelist as Charles Lever and Samuel Lover, for all her
life was spent in direct communion with the Irish race, and her
books were Irish books.&nbsp; It is, on the other hand, quite
unreasonable to deny that Charlotte Bront&euml; was a Yorkshire
woman.&nbsp; Only once at the end of her life did she visit
Ireland for a few weeks.&nbsp; Her Irish father and her Cornish
mother doubtless influenced her nature in many ways, but not less
certain was the influence of those wonderful moors around
Haworth, and the people among whom she lived.&nbsp; Neither
Ireland nor Cornwall has as much right to claim her as
Yorkshire.&nbsp; I am the last to disclaim the influence of what
is sometimes called &ldquo;Celticism&rdquo; upon English
literature; upon this point I am certain that Matthew Arnold has
said almost the last word.&nbsp; The Celts&mdash;not necessarily
the Irish, as there are three or four races of Celts in addition
to the Irish&mdash;have in the main given English literature its
fine imaginative quality, and even where he cannot trace a Celtic
origin to an English writer we may fairly assume that there is
Celtic blood somewhere in an earlier generation.</p>
<p><!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>Nevertheless, the impressions, as I have said, derived
from environment are of the utmost vitality, and assuredly Borrow
was an East Anglian, as Sir Thomas Browne was an East
Anglian.&nbsp; In each writer you can trace the influence of our
soil in a peculiar degree, and particularly in Borrow.&nbsp;
Borrow was proud of being an East Anglian, and we are proud of
him.&nbsp; In <i>Lavengro</i>, I venture to assert, we have the
greatest example of prose style in our modern literature, and I
rejoice to see a growing Borrow cult, a cult that is based not on
an acceptance of the narrower side of Borrow&mdash;his furious
ultra-Protestantism, for example&mdash;as was the popularity that
he once enjoyed, but upon the fact that he was a magnificent
artist in words.&nbsp; No artist in words but is influenced by
environment.&nbsp; Charles Kingsley, for example, who came from
quite different surroundings, was profoundly influenced by the
East Anglian fen-country:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They have a beauty of their own, those
great fens,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a beauty of the sea, of
boundless expanse and freedom.&nbsp; Overhead the arch of heaven
spreads more ample than elsewhere, and that vastness gives such
cloud-lands, such sunrises, such sunsets, as can be seen nowhere
else within these isles.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>But I must hasten on, although I would fain tarry long
over George Borrow and his works.&nbsp; I have said that East
Anglia is the country of great letter writers.&nbsp; First, there
was Margaret Paston.&nbsp; There is no such contribution to a
remote period of English history as that contained in the
<i>Paston Letters</i>, and I think we must associate them with
the name of a woman&mdash;Margaret Paston.&nbsp; Margaret&rsquo;s
husband, John Paston; her son, Sir John Paston; and her second
son, who, strangely enough, was also a John, and called himself
&ldquo;John Paston the Youngest,&rdquo; come frequently before us
in the correspondence, but Margaret Paston is the central
figure.</p>
<p>It may not be without interest to some of my hearers who are
married to recall that Margaret Paston addresses her husband not
as &ldquo;Dear John,&rdquo; or &ldquo;My dear John,&rdquo; as I
imagine a wife of to-day would do, but as &ldquo;Right Reverend
and Worshipful Husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nowhere is there such a
vivid picture of a bygone age as that contained in these
<i>Paston Letters</i>.&nbsp; We who sit quietly by the hearth in
the reign of King Edward VII may read what it meant to live by
the hearth in the reign of King Edward IV.&nbsp; It is <!-- page
144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>curious that the most humane documents of far-off times
in our history should all come from East Anglia, not only those
<i>Paston Letters</i>, brimful of the most vital interest
concerning the reigns of Henry VI and Edward IV, but also an even
earlier period&mdash;the life, or at least the monastic life in
the time of the first Richard and of King John is in a most
extraordinarily human fashion mirrored for us in that Chronicle
of St. Edmund&rsquo;s Bury Monastery known as the Jocelyn
Chronicle, published by the Camden Society, which Carlyle has
vitalized so superbly for us in <i>Past and Present</i>.</p>
<p>But I was speaking of the great letter writers, commencing
with Margaret Paston.&nbsp; Who are our greatest letter
writers?&nbsp; Undoubtedly they are Horace Walpole, William
Cowper and Edward FitzGerald.&nbsp; You know what a superb
picture of eighteenth century life has been presented to us in
the nine volumes of correspondence we have by Horace Walpole. <a
name="citation144"></a><a href="#footnote144"
class="citation">[144]</a>&nbsp; Walpole was to all practical
purposes an East Anglian, although he <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>happened to
be born in London.&nbsp; His father, the great Sir Robert
Walpole, was a notable East Anglian, and he had the closest ties
of birth and association with East Anglia.&nbsp; Many of his
letters were written from the family mansion of Houghton. <a
name="citation145"></a><a href="#footnote145"
class="citation">[145]</a></p>
<p>Next in order comes William Cowper.&nbsp; I believe that more
than one literary historian has claimed Cowper as a Norfolk
man.&nbsp; Cowper was born in Hertfordshire; he lived for a very
great deal of his life in Olney, in Buckinghamshire, in London
and in Huntingdon, but if ever there was a man who took on the
texture of East Anglian scenery and East Anglian life it was
Cowper.&nbsp; That beautiful river, the Ouse, which empties
itself into the Wash, was a peculiar inspiration to Cowper, and
those who know the scenery of Olney know that it has conditions
exactly <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>analogous in every way to those of
East Anglia.&nbsp; One of Cowper&rsquo;s most beautiful poems is
entitled &ldquo;On Receipt of my Mother&rsquo;s Portrait out of
Norfolk,&rdquo; and he himself, as I have said, found his last
resting-place on East Anglian soil&mdash;at East Dereham.</p>
<p>If there may be some doubt about Cowper, there can be none
whatever about Edward FitzGerald, the greatest letter-writer of
recent times.&nbsp; In mentioning the name of FitzGerald I am a
little diffident.&nbsp; It is like introducing &ldquo;King
Charles&rsquo;s head&rdquo; into this gathering; for was he not
the author of the poem known to all of us as the <i>Rubaiyat of
Omar Khayy&aacute;m</i>, and there is no small tendency to smile
to-day whenever the name of Omar Khayy&aacute;m is mentioned and
to call the cult a &ldquo;lunacy.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is perhaps
unfortunate that FitzGerald gave that somewhat formidable title
to his paraphrase, or translation, of the old Persian poet.&nbsp;
It is not the fault of those who admire that poem exceedingly
that it gives them a suspicion of affecting a scholarship that
they do not in most cases possess.&nbsp; What many of us admire
is not Omar Khayy&aacute;m the Persian, nor have we any desire to
see or to know <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>any other translation of that
poet.&nbsp; We simply admit to an honest appreciation of the poem
by Edward FitzGerald, the Suffolk squire, the poem that Tennyson
describes as &ldquo;the one thing done divinely
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; That poem by FitzGerald will live as long as
the English language, and let it never be forgotten that it is
the work of an East Anglian, an East Anglian who, like Borrow,
possessed a marked Celtic quality, the outcome of a famous Irish
ancestry, nevertheless of an East Anglian who loved its soil, its
rivers and its sea.</p>
<p>Then I come to another phase of East Anglian literary
traditions.&nbsp; It is astonishing what a zest for learning its
women have displayed; I might give you quite a long list of
distinguished women who have come out of East Anglia.&nbsp;
Crabbe must have had one in mind when he wrote of Arabella in one
of his <i>Tales</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>This reasoning maid, above her sex&rsquo;s
dread<br />
Had dared to read, and dared to say she read,<br />
Not the last novel, not the new born play,<br />
Not the mere trash and scandal of the day;<br />
But (though her young companions felt the shock)<br />
She studied Berkeley, Bacon, Hobbes and Locke.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one who perhaps made herself most <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>notorious
was Harriet Martineau, and in spite of her disagreeable egotism
it is still a pleasure to read some of her less controversial
writings.&nbsp; Her <i>Feats on the Fiord</i>, for example, is
really a classic.&nbsp; But I can never quite forgive Harriet
Martineau in that she spoke contemptuously of East Anglian
scenery, scenery which in its way has charms as great as any part
of Europe can offer.&nbsp; No, in this roll of famous women, the
two I am most inclined to praise are Sarah Austin and Fanny
Burney.&nbsp; Mrs. Austin was, you will remember, one of the
Taylors of Norwich, married to John Austin, the famous
jurist.&nbsp; She was one of the first to demonstrate that her
sex might have other gifts than a gift for writing fiction, and
that it was possible to be a good, quiet, domestic woman, and at
the same time an exceedingly learned one.&nbsp; Even before
Carlyle she gave a vogue to the study of German literature in
this country; she wrote many books, many articles, and made some
translations, notably what is still the best translation of von
Ranke&rsquo;s <i>History of the Popes</i>.&nbsp; In the
muster-roll of East Anglian worthies let us never forget this
singularly good woman, this correspondent of all the <!-- page
149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>most famous men of her day, of Guizot, of Grote, of
Gladstone, and one who also, as a letter-writer, showed that she
possessed the faculty that seems, as I have said, to be peculiar
to the soil of East Anglia.&nbsp; Still less must we forget Fanny
Burney, who, born in King&rsquo;s Lynn, lived to delight her own
generation by <i>Evelina</i> and by the fascinating <i>Diary</i>
that gives so pleasant a picture of Dr. Johnson and many another
of her contemporaries.&nbsp; <i>Evelina</i> and the <i>Diary</i>
are two of my favourite books, but I practise self-restraint and
will say no more of them here.</p>
<p>I now come to my ninth, and last, name among those East
Anglian worthies whom I feel that we have a particular right to
canonize&mdash;George Crabbe&mdash;&ldquo;though Nature&rsquo;s
sternest painter yet the best,&rdquo; as Byron described
him.&nbsp; Now it may be frankly admitted that few of us read
Crabbe to-day.&nbsp; He has an acknowledged place in the history
of literature, but there pretty well even well-read people are
content to leave him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have our literary critics
been about that they have suffered such a writer to drop into
neglect and oblivion?&rdquo; asks a recent Quarterly
Reviewer.&nbsp; He does not live as Cowper <!-- page 150--><a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>does by a
few lyrics and ballads and by incomparable letters.&nbsp;
Scarcely a line of Crabbe survives in current conversation.&nbsp;
If you turn to one of those handy volumes of
reference&mdash;Dictionaries of Quotation, as they are
called&mdash;from which we who are journalists are supposed to
obtain most of the literary knowledge that we are able to display
on occasion, you will scarcely find a dozen lines of
Crabbe.&nbsp; And yet I venture to affirm that Crabbe has a great
and permanent place in literature, and that as he has been a
favourite in the past, he will become a favourite in the
future.&nbsp; Crabbe can never lose his place in the history of
literature, a place as the forerunner of Wordsworth and even of
Cowper, but it would be a tragedy were he to drop out of the
category of poets that are read.&nbsp; A dainty little edition in
eight volumes is among my most treasured possessions.&nbsp; I
have read it not as we read some so-called literature, from a
sense of duty, but with unqualified interest.&nbsp; We have had
much pure realism in these latter days; why not let us return to
the most realistic of the poets.&nbsp; He was beloved by all the
greatest among his contemporaries.&nbsp; Scott and Wordsworth
<!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>were devoted to his work, and so also was Jane
Austen.&nbsp; At a later date Tennyson praised him.&nbsp; We have
heard quite recently the story of Mr. James Russell Lowell in his
last illness finding comfort in reading Scott&rsquo;s <i>Rob
Roy</i>.&nbsp; Let us turn to Scott&rsquo;s own last illness and
see what was the book he most enjoyed, almost on his
deathbed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Read me some amusing thing,&rdquo; said Sir
Walter, &ldquo;read me a bit of Crabbe.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
brought out the first volumes of his old favourite that I could
lay hand on,&rdquo; says Lockhart, &ldquo;and turned to what I
remembered was one of his favourite passages in it.&nbsp; He
listened with great interest.&nbsp; Every now and then he
exclaimed, &ldquo;Capital, excellent, excellent, very
good.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cardinal Newman and Edward FitzGerald at the opposite poles,
as it were, of religious impressions, agree in a devotion to
Crabbe&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp; Cardinal Newman speaks of <i>Tales
of the Hall</i> as &ldquo;a poem whether in conception or in
execution one of the most touching in our language,&rdquo; and in
a footnote to his <i>Idea of a University</i> he tells us that he
had read the poem thirty years earlier with extreme delight,
&ldquo;and have never lost my <!-- page 152--><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>love of
it,&rdquo; and he goes on to plead that it is an absolute
<i>classic</i>.</p>
<p>Not to have read Crabbe, therefore, is not to know one of the
most individual in the glorious muster-roll of English poets, and
Crabbe was pre-eminently an East Anglian, born and bred in East
Anglia, and taking in a peculiar degree the whole character of
his environment, as only Shakspere, Cowper and Wordsworth among
our great poets, have done.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me recapitulate that the names of Marryat,
Sir Thomas Browne, George Borrow, Margaret Paston, Horace
Walpole, Sarah Austin, Fanny Burney, Edward FitzGerald, and
George Crabbe are those that I prefer to associate with East
Anglian Literature.&nbsp; We are well aware that literature is
but an aspect of our many claims on the gratitude of those
Englishmen who have not the good fortune to be East
Anglians.&nbsp; We have given to the Empire a great scholar in
Porson, a great statesman in Sir Robert Walpole, a great lawyer
in Sir Edward Coke, great ecclesiastics in Cardinal Wolsey and
Archbishop Parker, great artists in Gainsborough, Constable and
Crome, and perhaps above all great sailors in Sir Cloudesley <!--
page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>Shovel and the ever memorable Lord Nelson.&nbsp;
Personally I admire a certain rebel, Kett the Tanner, as much as
any of those I have named.</p>
<p>Of all these East Anglian worthies the praise has often been
sung, but let me be pardoned if, on an occasion like this, I have
dwelt rather at length on the less familiar association of East
Anglia with letters.&nbsp; That I have but touched the fringe of
the subject is obvious.&nbsp; What might not be said, for
example, concerning Norwich as a literary centre under Bishop
Stanley&mdash;the Norwich of the Taylors and the Gurneys,
possessed of as much real intellectual life as London can boast
of to-day.&nbsp; What, again, might not be said of the influence
upon writers from afar.&nbsp; Read Kingsley&rsquo;s <i>Hereward
the Wake</i>, Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s <i>Midsummer Holiday</i>,
Charles Dickens&rsquo; description of Yarmouth and
Goldsmith&rsquo;s poetical description in his <i>Deserted
Village</i>, where clearly Houghton was intended. <a

a host of other memories touch the heart of all good East
Anglians, but that East Anglians do not forget the living in
doing honour to the dead is indicated by this gathering
to-night.&nbsp; We are grateful to Dr. Augustus Jessopp, to Mr.
Walter Rye, to Mr. Edward Clodd, and to our guest of this
evening, Mr. William Dutt, for keeping alive the folk-lore, the
literary history, the historical tradition of that portion of the
British Isles to which we feel the most profound attachment by
ties of residence or of kinship.</p>
<h2><!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>VI.&nbsp; DR. JOHNSON&rsquo;S
ANCESTRY</h2>
<p>A paper read before the members of the Johnson Club of London
at Simpson&rsquo;s Restaurant in the Strand.</p>
<p>There is, I believe, a definite understanding among our
members that we, the Brethren of the Johnson Club, have each and
all of us read every line about Dr. Johnson that is in print, to
say nothing of his works.&nbsp; It is particularly accepted that
the thirteen volumes in which our late brother, Dr. Birkbeck
Hill, enshrined his own appreciation of our Great Man, are as
familiar to us all as are the Bible and the Book of Common
Prayer.&nbsp; For my part, with a deep sense of the
responsibility that must belong to any one who has rashly
undertaken to read a paper before the Club, I admit to having
supplemented these thirteen volumes by a reperusal of the little
book entitled <i>Johnson Club Papers</i>, by Various Hands,
issued in 1899 by Brother Fisher Unwin.&nbsp; I feel as I reread
these addresses that there were indeed giants in those days, <!--
page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>although my admiration was moderated a little when I
came across the statement of one Brother that Johnson&rsquo;s
proposal for an edition of Shakspere &ldquo;came to
nothing&rdquo;; and the statement of another that
&ldquo;Goldsmith&rsquo;s failings were almost as great and as
ridiculous as Boswell&rsquo;s;&rdquo; while my bibliographical
ire was awakened by the extraordinary declaration in an article
on &ldquo;Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s Library,&rdquo; that a first folio
edition of Shakspere might have realized &pound;250 in the year
1785.&nbsp; Still, I recognize the talent that illuminated the
Club in those closing years of the last century.&nbsp; Happily
for us, who love good comradeship, most of the giants of those
days are still in evidence with their polished armour and
formidable spears.</p>
<p>What can I possibly say that has not already been said by one
or other of the Brethren?&nbsp; Well, I have put together these
few remarks in the hopes that no one of you has seen two books
that are in my hands, the first, <i>The Reades of Blackwood
Hill</i>, <i>with Some Account of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s
Ancestry</i>, by Aleyn Lyell Reade; the other, <i>The Life and
Letters of Dr. Birkbeck Hill</i>, by his daughter Mrs.
Crump.&nbsp; The first of these <!-- page 159--><a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>is
privately printed, although it may be bought by any one of the
Brethren for a couple of guineas.&nbsp; As far as I am able to
learn, Brother Augustine Birrell is the only one of the Brethren
who has as yet purchased a copy.&nbsp; The other book, our
Brother Birkbeck Hill&rsquo;s biography, is to be issued next
week by Mr. Edward Arnold, who has kindly placed an early copy at
my disposal.&nbsp; In both these volumes there is much food for
reflection for all good Johnsonians.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s
ancestry, it may be, makes little appeal to the crowd, but it
will to the Brethren.&nbsp; There is no more favourite subject
for satire than the tendency to minute study of an author and his
antecedents.&nbsp; But the lover of that author knows the
fascination of the topic.&nbsp; He can forgive any amount of
zeal.&nbsp; I confess that personally I stand amazed at the
variety and interest of Mr. Reade&rsquo;s researches.&nbsp; Let
me take a sample case of his method before coming to the main
issue.&nbsp; In the opening pages of Boswell&rsquo;s
<i>Johnson</i> there is some account of Mr. Michael Johnson, the
father.&nbsp; The most picturesque anecdote told of Johnson
Senior is that concerning a young woman of Leek in Staffordshire,
who <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>while he served his apprenticeship
there conceived a passion for him, which he did not return.&nbsp;
She followed him to Lichfield, where she took lodgings opposite
to the house in which he lived, and indulged her hopeless
flame.&nbsp; Ultimately she died of love and was buried in the
Cathedral at Lichfield, when Michael Johnson put a stone over her
grave.&nbsp; This pathetic romance has gone unchallenged by all
Boswell&rsquo;s editors, even including our prince of editors,
Dr. Birkbeck Hill.&nbsp; Mr. Reade, it seems to me, has
completely shattered the story, which, as all Johnsonian students
know, was obtained by Boswell from Miss Anna Seward.&nbsp; Mr.
Reade is able to show that Michael Johnson had been settled in
Lichfield for at least eleven years before the death of Elizabeth
Blaney, that for five years she had been the much appreciated
domestic in a household in that city.&nbsp; Her will indicates
moreover a great affection for her mistress and for that
mistress&rsquo;s son; she leaves the boy a gold watch and his
mother the rest of her belongings.&nbsp; The only connexion that
Michael Johnson would seem to have had with the woman was that he
and his brother were <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>called in after her decease to make
an inventory of her little property.&nbsp; I think that these
little facts about Mistress Blaney, her five years&rsquo;
residence at Lichfield apparently in a most comfortable position,
her omission of Michael Johnson from her will, and the fact that
he had been in Lichfield at least six months before she arrived,
are conclusive.</p>
<p>There is another picturesque fact about Michael Johnson that
Mr. Reade has brought to light.&nbsp; It would seem that twenty
years before his marriage to Sarah Ford, he had been on the eve
of marriage to a young woman at Derby, Mary Neyld; but the
marriage did not take place, although the marriage bond was drawn
out.&nbsp; Mary was the daughter of Luke Neyld, a prominent
tradesman of Derby; she was twenty-three years of age at the time
and Michael twenty-nine.&nbsp; Even Mr. Reade&rsquo;s industry
has not been able to discover for us why at the very last moment
the marriage was broken off.&nbsp; It explains, however, why
Michael Johnson married late in life and his melancholia.&nbsp;
The human romance that Mr. Reade has unveiled has surely a
certain interest for Johnsonians, for had Michael <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>Johnson brought his first love affair to a happy
conclusion, we should not have had the man described twenty years
later as &ldquo;possessed of a vile melancholy,&rdquo; who, when
his wife&rsquo;s tongue wagged too much, got upon his horse and
rode away.&nbsp; There would have been no Samuel Johnson, and
there would have been no Johnson Club&mdash;a catastrophe which
the human mind finds it hard to conceive of.&nbsp; Two years
after the breaking off of her engagement with Michael Johnson, I
may add, Mary Neyld married one James Warner.</p>
<p>Mr. Reade also calls in question another statement of
Boswell&rsquo;s, that Michael Johnson was really apprenticed at
Leek in Staffordshire; our only authority for this also is the
excellent Anna Seward.&nbsp; Further, it is sufficiently curious
that the names of two Samuel Johnsons are recorded as being
buried in one of the churches at Lichfield, one before our Samuel
came into the world, the other three years later: of these, one
died in 1654, the other in 1712.&nbsp; But these points, although
of a certain interest, have nothing to do with Dr.
Johnson&rsquo;s ancestry.&nbsp; Now before we left our homes this
evening, <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>each member of the Johnson
Brotherhood, as is his custom, turned up Brother Birkbeck
Hill&rsquo;s invaluable index to see what Johnson had to say upon
the subject of ancestry.&nbsp; We know that the Doctor was very
keen upon the founding of a family; that when Mr. Thrale lost his
only son Johnson&rsquo;s sympathies went out to him in a double
way, and perhaps in the greater degree because as he said to
Boswell, &ldquo;Sir, don&rsquo;t you know how you yourself
think?&nbsp; Sir, he wished to propagate his name.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Johnson himself, Boswell tells us, had no pretensions to
blood.&nbsp; &ldquo;I here may say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I
have great merit in being zealous for subordination and the
honours of birth; for I can hardly tell who was my
grandfather.&rdquo;&nbsp; Johnson further informed Mrs. Thrale
that he did not delight in talking much of his family:
&ldquo;There is little pleasure,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;in
relating the anecdotes of beggary.&rdquo;&nbsp; He constantly
deprecated his origin.&nbsp; According to Miss Seward, he told
his wife before he married her that he was of mean extraction;
but the letter in which Miss Seward gives her version of
Johnson&rsquo;s courtship is worth recalling, although I do not
believe a single word of it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>The rustic prettiness and artless
manners of her daughter, the present Mrs. Lucy Porter, had won
Johnson&rsquo;s youthful heart, when she was upon a visit at my
grandfather&rsquo;s in Johnson&rsquo;s school-days.&nbsp;
Disgusted by his unsightly form, she had a personal aversion to
him, nor could the beautiful verses he addressed to her teach her
to endure him.&nbsp; The nymph at length returned to her parents
at Birmingham, and was soon forgotten.&nbsp; Business taking
Johnson to Birmingham on the death of his own father, and calling
upon his coy mistress there, he found her father dying.&nbsp; He
passed all his leisure hours at Mr. Porter&rsquo;s, attending his
sick bed, and in a few months after his death, asked Mrs.
Johnson&rsquo;s consent to marry the old widow.&nbsp; After
expressing her surprise at a request so
extraordinary&mdash;&ldquo;No, Sam, my willing consent you will
never have to so preposterous a union.&nbsp; You are not
twenty-five, and she is turned fifty.&nbsp; If she had any
prudence, this request had never been made to me.&nbsp; Where are
your means of subsistence?&nbsp; Porter has died poor, in
consequence of his wife&rsquo;s expensive habits.&nbsp; You have
great talents, but, as yet, have turned them into no profitable
channel.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mother, I have not deceived Mrs.
Porter: I have told her the worst of me; that I am of mean
extraction; that I have no money, and that I have had an uncle
hanged.&nbsp; She replied, that she valued no one more or less
for his descent; that she had no more money than myself; and
that, although she had not had a relation hanged, she had fifty
who deserved hanging.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>Now why did Dr. Johnson take this attitude about his
ancestry, so contrary to the spirit that guided him where other
people&rsquo;s genealogical trees were concerned?&nbsp; It was
certainly not indifference to family ties, because Brother
Birkbeck Hill publishes many interesting letters written by
Johnson in old age, when finding that he had a certain sum of
money to bequeath, he looked around to see if there were any of
his own kin living.&nbsp; The number of letters the old man
wrote, inquiring for this or that kinsman, are quite
pathetic.&nbsp; It seems to me that it was really due to an
ignorant vagueness as to his family history.&nbsp; During his
early years his family had passed from affluence to penury.&nbsp;
They were of a type very common in England, but very rare in
Scotland and Ireland, that take no interest whatever in
pedigrees, and never discuss any but their immediate relations,
with whom, in the case of the Johnsons, very friendly terms did
not prevail.&nbsp; I think we should be astonished if we were to
go into some shops in London of sturdy prosperous tradesmen in
quite as good a position as old Michael Johnson, and were to try
and draw out one or other individual upon <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>his
ancestry.&nbsp; We should promptly come against a blank wall.</p>
<p>What then do we know of Johnson&rsquo;s father from the
ordinary sources?&nbsp; That he was a bookseller at Lichfield,
and that he was Sheriff of that city in the year that his son
Samuel was born; that he feasted the citizens, as Johnson tells
us, in his <i>Annals</i>, with &ldquo;uncommon
magnificence.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is described by Johnson as &ldquo;a
foolish old man,&rdquo; because he talked with too fond a pride
of his children and their precocious ways.&nbsp; He was a zealous
High Churchman and Jacobite.&nbsp; We are told by Boswell
further, on the authority of Mr. Hector of Birmingham, that he
opened a bookstall once a week in that city, but lost money by
setting up as a maker of parchment.&nbsp; &ldquo;A pious and most
worthy man,&rdquo; Mrs. Piozzi tells us of him, &ldquo;but
wrong-headed, positive and affected with
melancholia.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I inherited a vile melancholy
from my father,&rdquo; Johnson tells us, &ldquo;which has made me
mad all my life.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he died in 1731 his effects
were estimated at &pound;20.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mother had no value
for his relations,&rdquo; Johnson tells us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those we
knew were much lower than hers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of Michael
Johnson&rsquo;s <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>brother, Andrew, Johnson&rsquo;s
uncle, we know still less.&nbsp; From the various Johnson books
we only cull the story mentioned in Mrs. Piozzi&rsquo;s
<i>Anecdotes</i>.&nbsp; She relates that Johnson, after telling
her of the prowess of his uncle, Cornelius Ford, at jumping, went
on to say that he had another uncle, Andrew&mdash;&ldquo;my
father&rsquo;s brother, who kept the ring at Smithfield for a
whole year, and was never thrown or conquered.&nbsp; Here are
uncles for you, Mistress, if that is the way to your
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Reade has supplemented this by showing us
that not only was Andrew Johnson a skilful wrestler, but that he
was a very good bookseller.&nbsp; For a time he assisted his
brother in the conduct of the business at Lichfield.&nbsp; Later,
however, he settled as a bookseller at Birmingham, which was to
be his home until his death over thirty years later.&nbsp; Here
he published some interesting books; the title-pages of some of
these are given by Mr. Reade, who reproduces of course his
will.&nbsp; He had a son named Thomas who fell on evil
days.&nbsp; You will find certain letters to Thomas in Birkbeck
Hill&rsquo;s edition; Dr. Johnson frequently helped him with
money.</p>
<p>Of more interest, however, than Andrew <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Johnson was
Catherine, the one sister of Michael and Andrew, an aunt of
Samuel&rsquo;s, who was evidently for some unknown reason ignored
by her two brothers.&nbsp; Here we are not on absolutely firm
ground, but it seems to me clear that Catherine Johnson married
into a position far above her brothers.&nbsp; A fortnight before
his death Dr. Johnson wrote to the Rev. William Vyse, Rector of
Lambeth; a letter in which he asked him to find out
&ldquo;whether Charles Skrymsher&rdquo;&mdash;he misspelt it
&ldquo;Scrimshaw&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;of
Woodseaves&rdquo;&mdash;he misspelt it
&ldquo;Woodease&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;in your neighbourhood, be now
alive,&rdquo; and whether he could be found without delay.&nbsp;
He added that &ldquo;it will be an act of great kindness to
me,&rdquo; Charles Skrymsher being &ldquo;very nearly
related.&rdquo;&nbsp; Charles Skrymsher was not found, and
Johnson told Dr. Vyse that he was disappointed in the inquiries
that he had made for his relations.&nbsp; This particular
relation, indeed, had been twenty-two years dead when Dr.
Johnson, probably with the desire of leaving him something in his
will, made these inquiries.&nbsp; His mother, Mrs. Gerald
Skrymsher, was Michael Johnson&rsquo;s sister.&nbsp; One of her
daughters became the wife of Thomas <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>Boothby.&nbsp; Boothby was twice married, and his two
wives were cousins, the first, Elizabeth, being the daughter of
one Sir Charles Skrymsher, the second, Hester, as I have said, of
Gerald Skrymsher, Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s uncle.&nbsp; Hence Johnson
had a cousin by marriage who was a potentate in his day, for it
is told of Thomas Boothby of Tooley Park, grand-nephew of a
powerful and wealthy baronet, that he was one of the fathers of
English sport.&nbsp; An issue of <i>The Field</i> newspaper for
1875 contains an engraving of a hunting horn then in the
possession of the late Master of the Cheshire Hounds, and upon
the horn is the inscription: &ldquo;Thomas Boothby, Esq., Tooley
Park, Leicester.&nbsp; With this horn he hunted the first pack of
fox hounds then in England fifty-five years.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died
in 1752.&nbsp; His eldest son took the maternal name of
Skrymsher, and under the title of Thomas Boothby Skrymsher became
M.P. for Leicester, and an important person in his day.&nbsp; His
wife was Anne, daughter of Sir Hugh Clopton of New Place,
Stratford-on-Avon.&nbsp; Admirers of Mrs. Gaskell will remember
the Clopton legend told by her in Howett&rsquo;s <i>Visits to
Remarkable Places</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>I wish that I had time to follow Mr. Reade through all
the ramifications of an interesting family history, but I venture
to think that there is something pathetic in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s
inquiries a fortnight before his death as to cousins of whose
life story he knew nothing, whose well-known family home of
Woodseaves he&mdash;the great Lexicographer&mdash;could not spell
correctly, and of whose very name he was imperfectly
informed.&nbsp; Yet he, the lover of family trees and of
ancestral associations, was all his life in ignorance of these
wealthy connexions and their many substantial intermarriages.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Reade it was known that Johnson&rsquo;s father was
a manufacturer of parchment as well as a bookseller; but it was
supposed that only in his last few years or so of life did he
undertake this occupation which ruined him.&nbsp; Mr. Reade shows
that he had been for thirty years engaged in this trade in
parchment.&nbsp; Brother Birkbeck Hill quotes Croker, who hinted
that Johnson&rsquo;s famous definition of Excise as &ldquo;a
hateful tax levied upon commodities, and adjudged not by the
Common Judge of Property but by wretches hired by those to whom
Excise is paid,&rdquo; was <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>inspired by
recollections of his father&rsquo;s constant disputes with the
Excise officers.&nbsp; Mr. Reade has unearthed documents
concerning the crisis of this quarrel, when Michael Johnson in
1718 was indicted &ldquo;for useing ye Trade of a
Tanner.&rdquo;&nbsp; The indictment, which is here printed in
full, charges him, &ldquo;one Michael Johnson, bookseller,&rdquo;
&ldquo;that he did in the third year of the reign of our Lord
George by the Grace of God now King of Great Britain, for his own
proper gain, get up, use and exercise the art, mystery or manual
occupation of a Byrseus, in English a Tanner, in which art,
mystery or manual occupation of a Tanner the said Michael Johnson
was not brought up or apprenticed for the space of seven years,
an evil example of all others offending in such like
case.&rdquo;&nbsp; Michael&rsquo;s defence was that he was
&ldquo;tanned for&rdquo; and did not tan himself, he being only
&ldquo;a merchant in skins tradeing to Ireland, Scotland and the
furthermost parts of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; The only known example
of Michael Johnson&rsquo;s handwriting is this defence.&nbsp;
Michael was committed for trial but acquitted.&nbsp; It is
probable, however, that this prosecution laid the foundation of
his ruin.</p>
<p><!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>But I must pass on to the other branch: the family of
Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; Here Dr. Johnson did himself a
great injustice, for he had a genuine right to count his
mother&rsquo;s &ldquo;an old family,&rdquo; although the term is
in any case relative.&nbsp; At any rate he could carry his
pedigree back to 1620.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the morning,&rdquo; says
Boswell, &ldquo;we had talked of old families, and the respect
due to them.&nbsp; Johnson said&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir, you have a right to that kind
of respect, and are arguing for yourself.&nbsp; I am for
supporting the principle, and I am disinterested in doing it, as
I have no such right.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, Boswell, in this opening chapter, refers to the
mother as &ldquo;Sarah Ford, descended of an ancient race of
substantial yeomanry in Warwickshire,&rdquo; and Johnson&rsquo;s
epitaph upon his mother&rsquo;s tomb describes her as &ldquo;of
the ancient family of Ford.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus one is considerably
bewildered in attempting to reconcile Johnson&rsquo;s
attitude.&nbsp; The only one of his family for whom he seems to
have had a good word was Cornelius Harrison, of whom, writing to
Mrs. Thrale, he said that he was &ldquo;perhaps the only one of
my relations who ever rose in fortune <!-- page 173--><a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>above
penury or in character above neglect.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Cornelius
was the son of John Harrison, who had married Johnson&rsquo;s
aunt, Ph&oelig;be Ford.&nbsp; Johnson&rsquo;s account of Uncle
John in his <i>Annals</i> is not flattering, but he was the son
of a Rector of Pilborough, whose father was Sir Richard Harrison,
one of the gentlemen of the King&rsquo;s Bedchamber, and a
personality of a kind.&nbsp; Cornelius, the reputable cousin,
died in 1748, but his descendants seem to have been a poor lot,
whatever his ancestors may have been.&nbsp; Mr. Reade traces
their history with all the relentlessness of the genealogist.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s great-grandfather was one Henry Ford, a yeoman
in Birmingham.&nbsp; One of his sons, Henry, Johnson&rsquo;s
grand-uncle, was born in 1628.&nbsp; He owned property at West
Bromwich and elsewhere, and was a fellow of Clifford&rsquo;s Inn,
London.&nbsp; Then we come to Cornelius
Ford&mdash;&ldquo;Cornelius Ford, gentleman,&rdquo; he is styled
in his marriage settlement.&nbsp; Cornelius died four months
before Samuel Johnson was born.&nbsp; Cornelius had a sister
Mary, who married one Jesson, and their only son, I may mention
incidentally, entered at Pembroke College in 1666, <!-- page
174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>sixty years before his second-cousin, our Samuel,
entered the same college.&nbsp; Another cousin by marriage was a
Mrs. Harriots, to whom Johnson refers in his <i>Annals</i>, and
also in his <i>Prayers and Meditations</i>.&nbsp; The only one of
Cornelius Ford&rsquo;s family referred to in the biographies is
Joseph Ford, the father of the notorious Parson Ford,
Johnson&rsquo;s cousin, of whom he several times speaks.&nbsp;
Joseph was a physician of eminence who settled at
Stourbridge.&nbsp; He married a wealthy widow, Mrs.
Hickman.&nbsp; He was a witness to the marriage of his sister
Sarah to Michael Johnson.&nbsp; There can be no doubt but that
the presence of Dr. Ford and his family at Stourbridge accounts
for Johnson being sent there to school in 1725.&nbsp; He stayed
in the house of his cousin Cornelius Ford, not as Boswell says
his <i>uncle</i> Cornelius, at Pedmore, about a mile from
Stourbridge.&nbsp; He walked in every day to the Grammar
School.&nbsp; A connexion of the boy, Gregory Hickman, was
residing next to the Grammar School.&nbsp; A kinsman of Johnson
and a descendant of Hickman, Dr. Freer, still lives in the
house.&nbsp; I met him at Lichfield recently, and he has sent me
a photograph of the very house, which stands to-day much <!--
page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>as it did when Johnson visited it, and wrote at
twenty-two, a sonnet to Dorothy Hickman &ldquo;playing at the
Spinet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dorothy was one of Johnson&rsquo;s three
early loves, with Ann Hector and Olivia Lloyd.&nbsp; Dorothy
married Dr. John Turtin and had an only child, Dr. Turtin, the
celebrated physician who attended Goldsmith in his last
illness.</p>
<p>I have not time to go through the record of all Dr.
Johnson&rsquo;s uncles on the maternal side, and do full justice
to Mr. Reade&rsquo;s industry and mastery of detail.&nbsp; I may,
however, mention incidentally that the uncle who was hanged, if
one was, must have been one of his father&rsquo;s brothers, for
to the Fords that distinction does not seem to have
belonged.&nbsp; Much that is entertaining is related of the
cousin Parson Ford, who, after sharing with the famous Earl of
Chesterfield in many of his profligacies, received from his
lordship the Rectory of South Luffenham.&nbsp; There is no
evidence, however, that Chesterfield ever knew that his at one
time chaplain and boon companion was cousin of the man who wrote
him the most famous of letters.</p>
<p>The mother of Cornelius Ford was a Crowley, <!-- page 176--><a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>and this
brings Johnson into relationship with London city worthies, for
Mrs. Ford&rsquo;s brother was Sir Ambrose Crowley, Kt., Alderman,
of London, the original of Addison&rsquo;s Jack Anvil.&nbsp; One
of Sir Ambrose Crowley&rsquo;s daughters married Humphrey
Parsons, sometime M.P. for London and twice Lord Mayor.&nbsp;
Thus we see that during the very years of Johnson&rsquo;s most
painful struggle in London one of his distant cousins or
connexions was Chief Magistrate of this City.&nbsp; Another
connexion, Elizabeth Crowley, was married in 1724 at Westminster
Abbey to John, tenth Lord St. John of Bletsoe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here
are ancestors for you, Mistress,&rdquo; Dr. Johnson might have
said to Mrs. Thrale if he had only known&mdash;if he had had a
genealogist at his elbow as well as a pushful biographer.</p>
<p>Mr. Reade prints the whole of the marriage settlement upon the
union of Johnson&rsquo;s mother and father.&nbsp; It is a very
elaborate document, and suggests the undoubted prosperity of the
parties at the time.&nbsp; The husband was fifty, the bride
thirty-seven.&nbsp; Samuel was not born until three years and
three months after the marriage.&nbsp; The pair frequently in
early married <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span

<p><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>But I must leave this fascinating volume.&nbsp; I
cannot find time to tell you all it has to say about the Porter
family.&nbsp; Mr. Reade is as informative when treating of the
Porters, of Mrs. Johnson and her daughter Lucy, as he is with the
family trees of which I have spoken.</p>
<p>I hasten on to Dr. Hill&rsquo;s <i>Life</i>, with which I am
only concerned here at the point where it is affected by Mr.
Reade&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; The reflection inevitably arises that
it is well-nigh impossible efficiently to do work involving
research unless one has an income derived from other
sources.&nbsp; Your historian in proportion to the value of his
work must be a rich man, and so must the biographer.&nbsp; Good
as Brother Birkbeck Hill&rsquo;s work was, it would have been
better if he had had more money.&nbsp; He might have had many of
these wills and other documents copied, upon the securing of
which Mr. Reade must have expended such very large sums.&nbsp;
Dr. Hill was fully alive to this.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had not some
private means,&rdquo; he wrote to a friend in 1897, &ldquo;I
could never edit Johnson and Boswell; but I do not get so well
paid as a carpenter.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I find
that he lost exactly &pound;3 <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>by
publishing <i>Dr. Johnson</i>: <i>his Friends and his
Critics</i>.&nbsp; He made &pound;320 by the first four
years&rsquo; sale of the &ldquo;Boswell.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
&pound;320, including American rights, made the bulk of his
payments for his many years&rsquo; work, and the book has not yet
gone into a second edition.&nbsp; I think 2,000 were
printed.&nbsp; There were between 40,000 and 50,000 copies of
Croker&rsquo;s editions sold, so that we must not be too boastful
as to the improved taste of the present age.&nbsp; &pound;320 is
a mere bagatelle to numbers of our present writers of utterly
foolish fiction.&nbsp; Several of them have been known to spend
double that sum on a single motor-car.&nbsp; In connexion with
this matter I cannot refrain from giving one passage from a
letter of Brother Hill&rsquo;s:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>My old friend D--- lamented that the two new
volumes (of my <i>Johnson Miscellanies</i>) are so dear as to be
above his reach.&nbsp; The net price is a guinea.&nbsp; On Sunday
he had eight glasses of hollands and seltzer&mdash;a shilling
each, a pint of stout and some cider, besides half a dozen cigars
or so.&nbsp; Two days&rsquo; abstinence from cigars and liquor
would have paid for my book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Crump, who writes her father&rsquo;s life, has expressed
regret to me that there is so little in <!-- page 180--><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>the book
concerning the Johnson Club to which Brother Hill was so
devoted.&nbsp; She had asked me for letters, but I felt that all
in my possession were unsuited for publication, dealing rather
freely with living persons.&nbsp; Brother Hill was impatient of
the mere bookmaker&mdash;the literary charlatan who wrote without
reading sufficiently.&nbsp; There are two pleasant glimpses of
our Club in the volume; I quote one.&nbsp; It was of the night
that we discussed <i>Dr. Johnson as a Radical</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I wish that you and Lucy could have been present
last night and witnessed my scene of triumph.&nbsp; I was indeed
most nobly welcomed.&nbsp; The scribe told me with sympathetic
pride that the correspondent of the <i>New York Herald</i> had
asked leave to attend, as he wished to telegraph my paper out to
America!!! as well as the discussion.&nbsp; There were some very
good speeches made in the discussion that followed, especially by
a Mr. Whale, a solicitor, who spoke remarkably well and with
great knowledge of his <i>Boswell</i>.&nbsp; He said that he
preferred to call it, not Johnson&rsquo;s radical side, but his
humanitarian side.&nbsp; Mr. Birrell, the <i>Obiter Dicta</i>
man, also spoke very well.&nbsp; He is a clever fellow.&nbsp; He
was equally complimentary.&nbsp; He maintained in opposition to
Mr. Whale that radical was the right term, and in fact that
radicalism and humanitarianism were the same.&nbsp; Many of <!--
page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>them said what a light the paper had thrown on
Johnson&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; One gentleman came up and
congratulated me on the very delicate way in which I had handled
so difficult a subject, and had not given offence to the Liberal
Unionists and Tories present.&nbsp; Edmund Gosse, by whom I sat,
was most friendly, and called the paper a wonderful <i>tour de
force</i>, referring to the way in which I had linked
Johnson&rsquo;s sayings.&nbsp; He asked me to visit him some day
at Trinity College, Cambridge, and assured me of a hearty
welcome.&nbsp; It is no wonder that what with the supper and the
smoke I did not get to sleep till after two.&nbsp; Among the
guests was the great Bonner, the Australian cricketer, whose
health had been drunk with that of the other visitors, and his
praise sounded at having hit some balls over the pavilion at
Lord&rsquo;s.&nbsp; With great simplicity he said that after
seeing the way in which Johnson&rsquo;s memory was revered, he
would much rather have been such a man than have gained his own
greatest triumphs at cricket.&nbsp; He did not say it jocularly
at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another letter from Dr. Hill describes how he found himself at
Ashbourne in Derbyshire with the Club, or rather with a fragment
of it.&nbsp; He wrote from the <i>Green Man</i> there concerning
his adventures.</p>
<p>I have far exceeded my time, but I would like in conclusion to
say how admirably his daughter has written this book on our
Brother Birkbeck <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>Hill.&nbsp; What a pleasant picture
it presents of a genuine lover of literature.&nbsp; His was not
an analytical mind nor was he a great critic.&nbsp; His views on
Dante and Newman will not be shared by any of us.&nbsp; But, what
is far more important than analysis or criticism, he had an
entirely lovable personality and was a most clubbable man.&nbsp;
He was moreover the ideal editor of Boswell.&nbsp; What more
could be said in praise of a beloved Brother of the Johnson
Club!</p>

Lassalle</span>, <i>August</i> 9, 1864.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>I.&nbsp; The Countess Sophie von Hatzfeldt.</h3>
<p>Ferdinand Lassalle was born at Breslau on April 11,
1825.&nbsp; His parents were of Jewish race, his father a
successful silk merchant.&nbsp; From boyhood he was now the
tyrant, now the slave of a mother whom he loved and by whom he
was adored.&nbsp; Heymann Lassal&mdash;his son changed the <!--
page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>spelling during his Paris sojourn&mdash;appears to have
been irritable and tyrannical; and there are some graphic
instances in the recently published &ldquo;Diary&rdquo; <a
name="citation186"></a><a href="#footnote186"
class="citation">[186]</a> of the differences between them,
ending on one occasion in the boy rushing to the river, where his
terrified father finds him hesitating on the brink, and becomes
reconciled.&nbsp; A more attractive picture of the old man is
that told of his visit to his son-in-law, Friedland, who had
married Lassalle&rsquo;s sister.&nbsp; Friedland was ashamed of
his Jewish origin, and old Lassalle startled the guests at dinner
by rising and frankly stating that he was a Jew, that his
daughter was a Jewess, and that her husband was of the same
race.&nbsp; The guests cheered, but the host never forgave his
too frank father-in-law.</p>
<p>Lassalle was a student at Breslau University, and later at
Berlin, where he laid the foundation of those Hegelian studies to
which he owed his political philosophy.&nbsp; In 1845 he went to
Paris, and there secured the friendship of Heine, being included
with George Sand in the interesting circle around the
&ldquo;mattress grave&rdquo; of the sick poet.</p>
<p><!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>Among Heine&rsquo;s letters <a
name="citation187"></a><a href="#footnote187"
class="citation">[187]</a> there are four addressed to Lassalle,
now as &ldquo;Dear and best beloved friend,&rdquo; now as
&ldquo;Dearest brother-in-arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Be
assured,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that I love you beyond
measure.&nbsp; I have never before felt so much confidence in any
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have found in no one,&rdquo; he says
again, &ldquo;so much passion and clearness of intellect united
in action.&nbsp; You have good right to be audacious&mdash;we
others only usurp this Divine right, this heavenly
privilege.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to Varnhagen von Ense he
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>My friend, Herr Lassalle, who brings you this
letter, is a young man of the most remarkable intellectual
gifts.&nbsp; With the most thorough erudition, with the widest
learning, with the greatest penetration that I have ever known,
and with the richest gift of exposition, he combines an energy of
will and a capacity for action which astonish me. . . . In no one
have I found united so much enthusiasm and practical
intelligence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In every line,&rdquo; says Brandes, &ldquo;this letter
shows the far-seeing student of life, indeed, the
prophet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lassalle is not backward in reciprocating the enthusiasm.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>&ldquo;I love Heine,&rdquo; he
declares; &ldquo;he is my second self.&nbsp; What audacity! what
crushing eloquence!&nbsp; He knows how to whisper like a zephyr
when it kisses rose-blooms, how to breathe like fire when it
rages and destroys; he calls forth all that is tenderest and
softest, and then all that is fiercest and most daring.&nbsp; He
has the command of all the range of feeling.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lassalle&rsquo;s sympathy with Heine never lessened.&nbsp; It
was Heine who lost grasp of the intrinsically higher nature of
his countryman and co-religionist, and an acute difference
occurred, as we shall see, when Lassalle interfered in the
affairs of the Countess von Hatzfeldt.&nbsp; Introduced to the
Countess by his friend Dr. Mendelssohn, in 1846, Lassalle felt
that here in concrete form was scope for all his enthusiasm of
humanity, and he determined to devote his life to championing the
cause of the oppressed lady. <a name="citation188"></a><a
href="#footnote188" class="citation">[188]</a>&nbsp; The Countess
<!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>was the wife of a wealthy and powerful nobleman, who
ill-treated her shamefully.&nbsp; He imprisoned her in his
castles, refused her doctors and medicine in sickness, and
carried off her children.&nbsp; Her own family, as powerful as
the Count, had often intervened, and the Count&rsquo;s
repentances were many but short-lived.&nbsp; In 1846 matters
reached a crisis.&nbsp; The Count wrote to his second son, <!--
page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>Paul, asking him to leave his mother.&nbsp; The boy
carried this letter to the Countess; and Lassalle relates that,
finding the lady in tears, he persuaded her to a full disclosure
of the facts.&nbsp; He pledged himself to save her, and for nine
years carried on the struggle, with ultimate victory, but with
considerable loss of reputation.&nbsp; He first told the story to
Mendelssohn and Oppenheim, two friends of great wealth, the
latter a Judge of one of the superior courts in Prussia.&nbsp;
They agreed to help him; for then, as always, Lassalle&rsquo;s
persuasive powers were irresistible.&nbsp; They went with him
from Berlin to D&uuml;sseldorf, the Count being in that
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Von Hatzfeldt was at Aix-la-Chapelle, caught
in the toils of a new mistress, the Baroness Meyendorff.&nbsp;
Lassalle discovered that she had obtained from the Count a deed
assigning to her some property which should in the ordinary
course have come to the boy Paul.&nbsp; The Countess, hearing of
the disaster which seemed likely to befall her favourite son,
made her way into her husband&rsquo;s presence, and in the scene
which followed secured a promise that the document should be
revoked&mdash;destroyed.&nbsp; But no sooner had she left him
than <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>the Count returned to the Meyendorff
influence, and refused to see his wife again.&nbsp; Soon
afterwards it was discovered that the woman had set out for
Cologne.&nbsp; Lassalle begged his friends Oppenheim and
Mendelssohn, to follow her and, if possible, to ascertain whether
the momentous document had actually been destroyed.&nbsp; They
obeyed, and reached the hotel at Cologne about the same time as
the Baroness.&nbsp; Here they were guilty of an indiscretion, if
of nothing worse, for which Lassalle can surely in no way be
blamed, but which was used for many a year to tarnish his
name.&nbsp; Oppenheim, on his way upstairs, observed a servant
with the luggage of the Baroness; among other things a desk or
casket of a kind commonly used to carry valuable papers.&nbsp;
Thinking only of the fact that it was desirable to obtain a
certain document from the brutal Count, he pounced upon the
casket when the servant&rsquo;s back was turned.&nbsp; But he had
no luggage with him in which to conceal it, and so handed it to
Mendelssohn.&nbsp; Mendelssohn, although fully sensible of the
blunder that had been committed, could not desert his friend, and
placed the casket in his trunk.</p>
<p><!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>The whole hotel was in an uproar when the Baroness
discovered her loss.&nbsp; The friends fled panic-stricken in
opposite directions.&nbsp; Suspicion immediately fell upon Dr.
Mendelssohn, because his room was seen to have been left in
confusion.&nbsp; He was pursued, but succeeded in escaping from a
railway carriage and fleeing to Paris, leaving his luggage in the
hands of the police.&nbsp; In his box some papers were found
which incriminated Oppenheim; and Oppenheim, a Judge of one of
the superior courts, and the son of a millionaire, was arrested
and imprisoned for theft!</p>
<p>Lassalle visited Oppenheim in prison, and extracted from him a
promise of silence as to the motive for his conduct.&nbsp; He
then threw himself vigorously into the struggle, both in the
press and in the law courts.&nbsp; Here he seems to have parted
company with Heine, because, as he tells us, &ldquo;the Baroness
Meyendorff was a friend of the Princess de Lieven, and the
Princess de Lieven was the mistress of Guizot, and Heine received
a pension from Guizot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oppenheim was acquitted in 1846, and Mendelssohn, who was
really innocent of the actual robbery, naturally thought it safe
to return to <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>Germany.&nbsp; He was, however,
tried before the assize court of Cologne, and sentenced to five
years&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp; Alexander von Humboldt obtained
a reduction of the sentence to one year, but on condition that
Mendelssohn should leave Europe.&nbsp; He went, after his release
from prison, to Constantinople, and when the Crimean war broke
out joined the Turkish army, dying on the march in 1854.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Germany rang for many years with the story of the
so-called robbery, and Lassalle&rsquo;s name was even more
associated therewith than were those of his more culpable
friends.&nbsp; And this was not unnatural, because he was engaged
year after year in continuous warfare with Count Hatzfeldt.&nbsp;
At length, in 1854, about the time that the unfortunate Dr.
Mendelssohn died in the East, he secured for the Countess
complete separation and an ample provision.</p>
<p>Lassalle&rsquo;s friendship with this lady inevitably gave
rise to scandal.&nbsp; But never surely was scandal so little
justified.&nbsp; She was twenty years his senior, and the
relation was clearly that of mother and son.&nbsp; In her letters
he is always &ldquo;my dear child,&rdquo; <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>and in his
she is the confidante of the innumerable troubles of mind and of
heart of which so impressionable a man as Ferdinand Lassalle had
more than his share.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are without reason and judgment where women are
concerned,&rdquo; she tells him, when he confides to her his
passion for Helene von D&ouml;nniges; and the remark opens out a
vista of confidences of which the world happily knows but
little.&nbsp; From the assize court of D&uuml;sseldorf, of all
places, we have a very definite glimpse of a good-looking man,
likely to be a favourite in the society of the opposite
sex:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ferdinand Lassalle,&rdquo; runs the
official document, &ldquo;aged twenty-three, a civilian, born at
Breslau, and dwelling recently at Berlin.&nbsp; Stands five feet
six inches in height, has brown curly hair, open forehead, brown
eyebrows, dark blue eyes, well proportioned nose and mouth, and
rounded chin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was indeed a favourite in Berlin drawing-rooms, pronounced
a &ldquo;Wunderkind&rdquo; by Humboldt, and enthusiastically
admired on all sides.&nbsp; But, assuming the story of Sophie
Solutzeff to be mythical, there is no evidence that Lassalle <!--
page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>had ever had any very serious romance in his life until
he met Helene von D&ouml;nniges.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Es ist eine alte Geschichte</i>,<br />
<i>Doch bleibt sie immer neu</i>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Heine</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>II.&nbsp; Helene von D&ouml;nniges</h3>
<p>Helene von D&ouml;nniges has told us the story in fullest
detail&mdash;the story of that tragic love which was to send
Lassalle to his too early death.&nbsp; She was the daughter of a
Bavarian diplomatist who had held appointments in Italy, and
later in Switzerland.&nbsp; She was betrothed as a child of
twelve to an Italian of forty years of age.&nbsp; At a time when,
as she says, her thoughts should have been concentrated upon her
studies, they were distracted by speculations on marriage and the
marriage tie.&nbsp; A young Wallachian student named Yanko
Racowitza crossed her path.&nbsp; His loneliness&mdash;he was far
from home and friends&mdash;kindled her sympathy.&nbsp; Dark and
ugly, she compared him to Othello, and called him her
&ldquo;Moor.&rdquo;&nbsp; In spite of some parental opposition
she insisted upon plighting her troth to him, and the Italian
lover was scornfully dismissed.&nbsp; Then comes <!-- page
196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>the opening scene of the present story.&nbsp; It was in
Berlin, whither Helen&mdash;we will adopt the English spelling of
the name&mdash;had travelled with her grandmother in 1862, that
she was asked at a ball the momentous question, &ldquo;Do you
know Lassalle?&rdquo;&nbsp; She had never heard his name.&nbsp;
Her questioner was Baron Korff, a son-in-law of Meyerbeer, who,
charmed by her originality, remarked that she and Lassalle were
made for one another.&nbsp; Two weeks later her curiosity was
further excited, when Dr. Karl Oldenberg let fall some similar
remark as to her intellectual kinship with the mysterious
Lassalle.&nbsp; She asked her grandmother about him, and was told
that he was a &ldquo;shameless demagogue.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she
turned to her lover, who promised to inquire.&nbsp; Racowitza
brought her information about the Countess, the casket, and other
&ldquo;sensations&rdquo;&mdash;only to excite her curiosity the
more.&nbsp; Finally a friend, Frau Hirsemenzel, undertook to
introduce her to the notorious Socialist.&nbsp; The introduction
took place at a party, and if her account is to be trusted, no
romance could be more dramatic than the actuality.&nbsp; They
loved one another at first sight, conversed with freedom, <!--
page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>and he called her by an endearing name as he offered
her his arm to escort her home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow it did not seem at all remarkable,&rdquo; she
says, &ldquo;that a stranger should thus call me &lsquo;Du&rsquo;
on first acquaintance.&nbsp; We seemed to fit to one another so
perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was in her nineteenth year, Lassalle in his
thirty-ninth.&nbsp; The pair did not see one another again for
some months, not in fact until Helen visited Berlin as the guest
of a certain lawyer Holthoff.&nbsp; Here she met Lassalle at a
concert, and the friendly lawyer connived at their being more
than once together.&nbsp; At a ball, on one occasion, Lassalle
asked her what she would do if he were sentenced to death, and
she beheld him ascending the scaffold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should wait till your head was severed,&rdquo; was
her answer, &ldquo;in order that you might look upon your beloved
to the last, and then&mdash;I should take poison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was pleased with her reply, but declared that there was no
fear&mdash;his star was in the ascendant!&nbsp; And so it seemed;
for although young Racowitza even then accosted him in the
ballroom, the friendly Holthoff soon arranged an <!-- page
198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>informal betrothal; and Lassalle was on the eve of a
great public triumph which seemed more likely to take him to the
throne than to the scaffold.</p>
<p>To many this will seem an exaggeration.&nbsp; Yet hear Prince
Bismarck in the Reichstag seventeen years after Lassalle&rsquo;s
death:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>He was one of the most intellectual and gifted men
with whom I have ever had intercourse, a man who was ambitious in
high style, but who was by no means Republican: he had very
decided national and monarchical sympathies, and the idea which
he strove to realize was the German Empire, and therein we had a
point of contact.&nbsp; Lassalle was extremely ambitious, and it
was perhaps a matter of doubt to him whether the German Empire
would close with the Hohenzollern dynasty or the Lassalle
dynasty; but he was monarchical through and through.&nbsp;
Lassalle was an energetic and very intellectual man, to talk with
whom was very instructive.&nbsp; Our conversations lasted for
hours, and I was always sorry when they came to an end. <a
name="citation198"></a><a href="#footnote198"
class="citation">[198]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The year 1864, which was to close so tragically, opened indeed
with extraordinary promise.&nbsp; Lassalle left Berlin in
May&mdash;Helen had gone <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>back to
Geneva two or three months earlier&mdash;travelling by Leipzig
and Cologne through the Rhenish provinces, and holding a
&ldquo;glorious review&rdquo; the while.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have never seen anything like it,&rdquo;
he writes to the Countess von Hatzfeldt.&nbsp; &ldquo;The entire
population indulged in indescribable jubilation.&nbsp; The
impression made upon me was that such scenes must have attended
the founding of new religions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it appeared possible that Heine&rsquo;s description of
Lassalle as the Messiah of the nineteenth century was to be
realized.&nbsp; The Bishop of Mayence was on his side, and the
King of Prussia sympathetic.&nbsp; As he passed from town to town
the whole population turned out to do him honour.&nbsp; Countless
thousands met him at the stations: the routes were ornamented
with triumphal arches, the houses decorated with wreaths, and
flowers were thrown upon him as he passed.&nbsp; As the cavalcade
approached the town of Ronsdorf, for example, it was easy to see
that the people were on tip-toe with expectation.&nbsp; At the
entrance an arch bore the inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>Willkommen dem Dr. Ferdinand
Lassalle<br />
Viel tausendmal im Ronsdorfer Thal!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under arches and garlands, smothered with flowers thrown by
young work-girls, whose fathers, husbands, brothers, cheered
again and again, Lassalle and his friends entered the town, while
a vast multitude followed in procession.&nbsp; It was at Ronsdorf
that Lassalle made the speech which had in it something of
fateful presentiment:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have not grasped this banner,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;without knowing quite clearly that I myself may
fall.&nbsp; The feelings which fill me at the thought that I may
be removed cannot be better expressed than in the words of the
Roman poet:</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Exoriare aliquis nostris ex ossibus
ultor</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>or in German, &lsquo;<i>M&ouml;ge</i>, <i>wenn ich beseitigt
werde</i>, <i>irgend ein R&auml;cher und Nachfolger aus meinen
Gebeinen auferstehen</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; May this great and
national movement of civilization not fall with my person, but
may the conflagration which I have kindled spread farther and
farther, so long as one of you still breathes.&nbsp; Promise me
that, and in token raise your right hands.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All hands were raised in silence, and the impressive scene
closed with a storm of acclamation.</p>
<p><!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>But Lassalle was worn out, and he fled for a time from
the storm and conflict to Switzerland.&nbsp; Helen at Geneva
heard of his sojourn at Righi-Kaltbad, and she made an excursion
thither with two or three friends, and thus on July 25 (1864) the
lovers met again.&nbsp; An account of their romantic interview
comes to us in Helen&rsquo;s own diary and in the letter which
Lassalle wrote to the Countess Hatzfeldt two days later.&nbsp;
Helen tells how they climbed the Kulm together, discussing by the
way the question of their marriage and the possibility of
opposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have your parents against me?&rdquo; asked
Lassalle; and was told that only once had she mentioned his name
before them, and that their horror of the Jew agitator had ever
since closed her mouth.&nbsp; So the conversation sped.&nbsp; The
next morning their hope of &ldquo;a sunrise&rdquo; was destroyed
by a fog.&nbsp; &ldquo;How often,&rdquo; says Helen, &ldquo;when
in later years I have stood upon the summit of the Righi and seen
the day break in all its splendour, have I recalled this foggy,
damp morning, and Lassalle&rsquo;s disappointment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he looked upon her, so pale and trembling, he abused the
climate, and promised that he <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>would give
up politics, devote himself to science and literature, and take
her to Egypt or India.&nbsp; He talked to her of the Countess,
&ldquo;who will think only of my happiness,&rdquo; and he talked
of religion.&nbsp; Was his Jewish faith against him in her
eyes?&nbsp; Mahommedanism and Judaism, it was all one to her, was
the answer, but paganism by preference!&nbsp; They parted, to
correspond immediately, and Lassalle to write to the astonished,
and in this affair, unsympathetic Countess, of the meeting with
his beloved.&nbsp; With the utmost friendliness, however, he
endeavoured to keep the elder lady at a distance for a time.</p>
<p>On July 20 Helen writes to him, repeating her promise to
become his wife.</p>
<blockquote><p>You said to me yesterday: &ldquo;Say but a
sensible and decided &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;&mdash;<i>et je me charge
du reste</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Good; I say
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;<i>chargez-vous donc du reste</i>.&nbsp;
I only require that we first do all in our power to win my
parents to a friendly attitude.&nbsp; To me belongs, however, a
painful task.&nbsp; I must slay in cold blood the true heart of
Yanko von Racowitza, who has given me the purest love, the
noblest devotion.&nbsp; With heartless egotism I must destroy the
day-dream of a noble youth.&nbsp; But for your sake I will even
do what is wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile Lassalle&rsquo;s unhappy attempts to <!-- page
203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>conciliate the Countess continue.&nbsp; He writes of
Helen&rsquo;s sympathy and dwells upon her entire freedom from
jealousy.&nbsp; He tells Frau von Hatzfeldt how much Helen is
longing to see his old friend.&nbsp; In conclusion, as though not
to show himself too blind a lover, he remarks that Helen&rsquo;s
one failing is a total lack of will.&nbsp; &ldquo;When, however,
we are man and wife,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;then shall I have
&lsquo;will&rsquo; enough for both, and she will be as clay in
the hands of the potter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Countess continues
obdurate, and in a further letter (Aug. 2) Lassalle
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>It is really a piece of extraordinary good fortune
that, at the age of thirty-nine and a half, I should be able to
find a wife so beautiful, so sympathetic, who loves me so much,
and who&mdash;an indispensable requirement&mdash;is so entirely
absorbed in my personality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Lassalle&rsquo;s request, Helen herself wrote thus to the
Baroness von Hatzfeldt:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear and Beloved
Countess</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>Armed with an introduction from my lord and master, I, his
affianced wife, come to you&mdash;unhappily only in
writing&mdash;<i>le c&oelig;ur et la main ouverte</i>, and beg of
you a little of that friendship which you have given to him so
abundantly.&nbsp; How deeply do I regret that your <!-- page
204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>illness separates us, that I cannot tell you face to
face how much I love and honour him, how ardently I long for your
help and advice as to how I can best make my beautiful and noble
eagle happy.&nbsp; This my first letter must necessarily seem
somewhat constrained to you; for I am an insignificant,
unimportant being, who can do nothing but love and honour him,
and strive to make him happy.&nbsp; I would fain dance and sing
like a child, and drive away all care from him.&nbsp; My one
desire is to understand his great and noble nature, and in good
fortune and in bad to stand faithful and true by his side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then followed a further appeal for the love and help of this
friend of Lassalle&rsquo;s early years.&nbsp; It was all in
vain.&nbsp; Instead of a letter, Helen received from the Countess
what she called &ldquo;a scrawl,&rdquo; and Lassalle a long
homily on his lack of judgment and foresight.&nbsp; Lassalle
defended himself, and so the not too pleasing correspondence went
on.</p>
<p>Yet these days in Berne were the happiest in the lives of
Lassalle and his betrothed.&nbsp; Helen was staying with a Madame
Aarson, and was constantly visited by her lover.&nbsp; It was
agreed between them that Lassalle should follow her to Geneva,
and see her parents.&nbsp; But no sooner had he entered his room
at the Pension Leovet, <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>in the
neighbourhood of the house of Herr von D&ouml;nniges, than a
servant handed him a letter from Helen.&nbsp; It told how on her
arrival she had found the whole house excited by the betrothal of
her sister Margaret to Count von Keyserling.&nbsp; Her
mother&rsquo;s delight in the engagement had tempted her
(contrary to Lassalle&rsquo;s express wish) to confidences, and
she had told of her love for the arch-agitator.&nbsp; Her mother
had turned upon her with loathing, execrated Lassalle without
stint, spoken scornfully of the Countess, the casket robbery, and
kindred matters.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is quite impossible,&rdquo;
urged the frantic woman, &ldquo;that Count Keyserling will unite
himself to a family with a connexion of this kind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The father joined in the upbraiding, the disowning of an
undutiful daughter.&nbsp; One has but to remember the vulgar,
tradesman instinct, which then, as now, guides the marriage
ideals of a certain class, to take in the whole situation at a
glance.</p>
<p>Lassalle had hardly begun to read the letter when Helen
appeared before him, and begged him to take her away
immediately&mdash;to France&mdash;anywhere!&nbsp; Her
father&rsquo;s violence, her mother&rsquo;s abuse, had driven her
to despair.</p>
<p><!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>Lassalle was indignant with her.&nbsp; Why had she not
obeyed him?&nbsp; He would speak to her father.&nbsp; All would
yet be well.&nbsp; But&mdash;she was compromised there&mdash;at
his hotel.&nbsp; Had she a friend in the neighbourhood?</p>
<p>At this moment her maid came in to say that there was a
carriage ready to take them to the station.&nbsp; A train would
start for Paris in a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; Helen renewed her
entreaty, but Lassalle remained resolute.&nbsp; He would only
receive her from her father.&nbsp; To what friend could he take
her?&nbsp; Helen named Madame Caroline Rognon, who beheld them
with astonishment.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Frau von D&ouml;nniges and her daughter
Margaret entered the house.&nbsp; Then followed a disagreeable
scene between Lassalle and the mother, ending, after many
scornful words thrown at the ever self-restrained lover, in Helen
being carried off before his eyes&mdash;indeed, by his
wish.&nbsp; Lassalle had shown dignity and self-restraint, but he
had killed the girl&rsquo;s love&mdash;until it was too late.</p>
<p>D&uuml;hring speaks of Lassalle&rsquo;s &ldquo;inconceivable
stupidity,&rdquo; and there is a great temptation at this date,
with all the circumstances before us, <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>to look at
the matter with D&uuml;hring&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; But to one whom
Heine had called a Messiah, whom Humboldt had termed a
&ldquo;Wunderkind,&rdquo; and Bismarck had greeted as among the
greatest men of the age, it may well have seemed flatly
inconceivable that this insignificant little Swiss diplomatist
could long refuse the alliance he proposed.&nbsp; Yet stronger
and more potent may have been the feeling&mdash;although of this
there is no positive evidence extant&mdash;that the social
movement which he had so much at heart could not well endure a
further scandal.&nbsp; The Hatzfeldt story had been used against
him frequently enough.&nbsp; An elopement&mdash;so sweetly
romantic under some circumstances&mdash;would have been the ruin
of his great political reputation.</p>
<p>Lassalle speedily regretted his course of action&mdash;what
man in love would not have done so?&mdash;but his first impulse
was consistent with the life of strenuous effort for the cause he
had embraced.&nbsp; To a romantic girl, however, his conduct
could but seem brutal and treacherous.&nbsp; Helen had done more
than enough.&nbsp; She had compromised herself irretrievably, and
an immediate marriage was imperatively demanded by the
conventionalities.&nbsp; <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>She was,
however, seized by a brutal father and confined to her room,
until she understood that Lassalle had left Geneva.&nbsp; Then
the entreaties of her family, the representation that her
sister&rsquo;s marriage, even her father&rsquo;s position, were
in jeopardy, caused her to declare that she would abandon
Lassalle.</p>
<p>At this point the story is conflicting.&nbsp; Helen herself
says that she never saw Lassalle again after he had handed her
over to her mother, and that after a long period of ill-usage and
petty persecution, she was hurried one night across the
lake.&nbsp; Becker, however, declares that as Lassalle and his
friend R&uuml;stow were walking in Geneva a carriage passed them
on the way to the station containing Helen and another lady, and
that Helen acknowledged their salute.&nbsp; Anyway, it is clear
that Helen went to Bex on August 9, and that Lassalle left Geneva
on the 13th.&nbsp; Letter after letter was sent by Lassalle to
Helen&mdash;one from Karlsruhe on the 15th, and one from Munich
on the 19th, but no answer.&nbsp; In Karlsruhe, according to von
Hofstetten, Lassalle wept like a child.&nbsp; His correspondence
with the Countess and with Colonel R&uuml;stow becomes forcible
<!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>in its demands for assistance.&nbsp; Writing to
R&uuml;stow, he tells of a two hours&rsquo; conversation with the
Bavarian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Baron von Schrenk, who
assures him of his sympathy, says that he cannot understand the
objections of von D&ouml;nniges, and that in similar
circumstances he would be proud of the alliance, although he
deprecated the political views of Lassalle.&nbsp; Finally this
accommodating Minister of State&mdash;here, at least, the
tragi-comedy is but too apparent&mdash;engages to send a lawyer,
Dr. Haenle, as an official commissioner to negotiate with the
obdurate father and refractory ambassador.</p>
<p>Richard Wagner, the great composer, the Bishop of Mayence, and
noblemen, generals, and scholars without number were also pressed
into the service, but in vain.&nbsp; The treachery of intimate
friends more than counterbalanced all that could be achieved by
well-meaning strangers.&nbsp; If Helen is to be
believed&mdash;and the charge is not
denied&mdash;Lassalle&rsquo;s friend Holthoff, sent to negotiate
in his favour, entreated her to abandon Lassalle, and to comply
with her parents&rsquo; wishes.&nbsp; Lassalle, he declared, was
not in any way a suitable <!-- page 210--><a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>husband,
and her father had decided wisely.&nbsp; The poor girl lived in a
constant atmosphere of petty persecution.&nbsp; Her father, she
was told, might lose his post in the Bavarian service if she
married this Socialist, her brother would have absolutely no
career open to him, her sisters could not marry in their own rank
of life; in fact, the whole family were alleged to be entirely
unhappy and miserable through her stubbornness.&nbsp; The
following letter&mdash;obviously dictated&mdash;was the not
unnatural outcome:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">To Herr Lassalle</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>I have again become reconciled to my betrothed bridegroom,
Herr Yanko von Racowitza, whose love I have regained, and I
deeply repent my earlier action.&nbsp; I have given notice of
this to your legal representative, Herr Holthoff, and I now
declare to you of my own free will and firm conviction, that
there never can be any further question of a marriage between us,
and that I hold myself in all respects to be released from such
an engagement.&nbsp; I am now firmly resolved to devote to my
aforesaid betrothed bridegroom my eternal love and fidelity.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Helene von
D&ouml;nniges</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter came through R&uuml;stow, and Lassalle <!-- page
211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>addressed the following reply to Helen, which, however,
she never received&mdash;it came in fact into the possession of
the Countess&mdash;a sufficient commentary on the duplicity and
the false friendship not only of Holthoff, but of Colonel
R&uuml;stow and the Countess Hatzfeldt in this sad affair.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Munich</span>, <i>Aug.</i> 20, 1864.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>My heart is breaking!&nbsp; R&uuml;stow&rsquo;s letter will
kill me.&nbsp; That you have betrayed me seems impossible!&nbsp;
Even now I cannot believe in such shamelessness, in such
frightful treachery.&nbsp; It is only for a moment that some one
has overridden your will and obliterated your true self.&nbsp; It
is inconceivable that this can be your real, your abiding
determination.&nbsp; You cannot have thrown aside all shame, all
love, all fidelity, all truth.&nbsp; If you did, you would
dishonour and disfigure humanity.&nbsp; There can be no truth
left in the world if you are false, if you are capable of
descending to this depth of abandonment, of breaking such holy
oaths, of crushing my heart.&nbsp; Then there is nothing more
under the sun in which a man can still believe.</p>
<p>Have you not filled me with a longing to possess you?&nbsp;
Have you not implored me to exhaust all proper measures, before
carrying you away from Wabern?&nbsp; Have you not by your own
lips and by your letters, sworn to me the most sacred
oaths?&nbsp; Have you not declared <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>to me, even
in your last letters, that you were nothing, nothing but my
loving wife, and that no power on earth should stay your
resolution?&nbsp; And now, after you have bound this true heart
of mine to yourself so strongly, this heart which when once it
gives itself away gives itself for ever; now, when the battle has
scarcely begun, do you cast me off?&nbsp; Do you betray me?&nbsp;
Do you destroy me?&nbsp; If so, you succeed in doing what else no
fate can do; you will have crushed and shattered one of the
hardest of men, who could withstand unflinchingly all outward
storms.&nbsp; No, I can never survive such treachery.&nbsp; It
will kill me inwardly and outwardly.&nbsp; It is not possible
that you are so dishonourable, so shameless, so reckless of duty,
so utterly unworthy and infamous.&nbsp; If you were, you would
deserve of me the most deadly hatred.&nbsp; You would deserve the
contempt of the world.&nbsp; Helen, it is not your own resolution
which you have communicated to R&uuml;stow.&nbsp; Some one has
fastened it upon you by a coercion of your better feelings.&nbsp;
Listen to me.&nbsp; If you abide by this resolution, you will
lament it as long as you live.</p>
<p>Helen, true to my words, &ldquo;<i>Je me charge du
reste</i>,&rdquo; I shall stay here, and shall take all possible
steps to break down your father&rsquo;s opposition.&nbsp; I have
already excellent means in my hand, which will certainly not
remain unused, and if they do not succeed, I shall still possess
thousands of other means, and I will grind all hindrances to dust
if you will but remain true to me.&nbsp; If you remain true,
there is no limit to my strength or to my love of you, <i>Je me
charge toujours du reste</i>!&nbsp; The battle is <!-- page
213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>hardly begun, you cowardly girl.&nbsp; But can it be,
that while I sit here, and have already achieved what seemed
impossible, you are betraying me, and listening to the flattering
words of another man?&nbsp; Helen, my fate is in your
hands!&nbsp; But if you destroy me by this wicked treachery, from
which I cannot recover, then may evil fall upon you, and my curse
follow you to the grave!&nbsp; This is the curse of a true heart,
of a heart that you wantonly break, and with which you have
cruelly trifled.&nbsp; Yes, this curse of mine will surely strike
you.</p>
<p>According to R&uuml;stow&rsquo;s message, you want your
letters to be returned to you.&nbsp; In any case, you will never
receive them otherwise than from me&mdash;after a personal
interview.&nbsp; For I must and will speak to you personally, and
to you alone.&nbsp; I must and will hear my death-doom from your
own lips.&nbsp; It is only thus that I can believe what otherwise
seems impossible to me.</p>
<p>I am continuing here to take further steps to win you, and
when I have done all that is possible, I shall come to
Geneva.&nbsp; Helen, our destinies are entwined!</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">F.
Lassalle</span>. <a name="citation213"></a><a href="#footnote213"
class="citation">[213]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is pitiable to realize the amount of false or imperfect
friendship which led Lassalle on to his ruin.&nbsp; R&uuml;stow
was false, and Holthoff was false, if it were not rather that
both looked upon Lassalle&rsquo;s affection for this girl, half
his age, as a <!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>mad freak to be cured and
forgotten.&nbsp; More might have been expected from the Countess,
to whom Lassalle had given so much pure and disinterested
devotion; but here again, a sense of maternal ownership in
Lassalle was sufficient to justify, in such a woman, any means to
keep him apart from this fancy of the hour.&nbsp; To the
Countess, however, Helen had turned for help, and had received a
note which had but enraged her, and made the breach between her
and Lassalle yet wider.&nbsp; In the after years, Helen published
one letter and the Countess another as the actual reply of the
Countess to Helen&rsquo;s appeal, and the truth will now never be
known.&nbsp; Meanwhile Dr. Arndt, a nephew of von D&ouml;nniges,
had gone to Berlin to fetch Yanko von Racowitza.&nbsp; Of Yanko
Helen has herself given us a pleasant picture, as the one man for
whom she really cared until the overwhelming presence of Lassalle
appeared upon the scene, as her one friend during her
persecution.&nbsp; Absent from Lassalle&rsquo;s influence, it was
not strange that the delicate Wallachian&mdash;even younger than
herself and the slave of her every whim&mdash;should have an
influence in her life.&nbsp; Had Lassalle, however, had <!-- page
215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>yet another personal interview with her, there can
scarcely be a doubt that she would have been as he had once said,
&ldquo;as clay in the hands of the potter&rdquo;&mdash;but this
was not to be.&nbsp; Lassalle came back to Geneva on August 23,
and immediately wrote an earnest letter to Herr von
D&ouml;nniges, begging for an interview, and stating that he had
not the least enmity towards him for what had happened.&nbsp;
With the fear of the Foreign Minister at Munich before his eyes
Helen&rsquo;s father could not well refuse again, and the
interview took place.&nbsp; Lassalle, according to von
D&ouml;nniges, demanded that Yanko von Racowitza should be
forbidden the house, while he himself should have ready access to
Helen.&nbsp; He further charged von D&ouml;nniges with cruelty to
his daughter, and was called a liar to his face, while even the
cook was called upon the scene to give her evidence as to the
domestic ethics of this family circle.&nbsp; The letter of von
D&ouml;nniges to Dr. Haenle was clearly meant to be shown to the
Foreign Minister, and the wily diplomatist naturally took the
opportunity both to justify himself and to vilify Lassalle.&nbsp;
Then began a painful dispute as to whether Herr von D&ouml;nniges
<!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>had ill-used his daughter; the overwhelming evidence,
which includes the testimony of that daughter, written long after
her father&rsquo;s death, tending to prove the truth of
Lassalle&rsquo;s allegation.&nbsp; Lassalle meanwhile found no
opportunity of approaching Helen, and having every reason to
believe that she was entirely faithless, gave up the
struggle.&nbsp; He referred to the girl in language
characteristic of a despairing and jilted lover, and sent von
D&ouml;nniges a challenge, although many years before, in a
political controversy, he had declined to fight&mdash;on
principle.&nbsp; His seconds were to be General Becker and
Colonel R&uuml;stow, and the latter has left us a long account of
the affair.</p>
<p>On the appointed day, August 22, R&uuml;stow went everywhere
to look for Herr von D&ouml;nniges, but the minister had fled to
Berne.&nbsp; R&uuml;stow then saw Lassalle at the rooms of the
Countess von Hatzfeldt.&nbsp; Lassalle mentioned that he had that
morning had his challenge accepted by von Racowitza, whose
seconds were Count Keyserling and Dr. Arndt.&nbsp; R&uuml;stow
insisted, both to Lassalle and to Racowitza&rsquo;s friends, that
von D&ouml;nniges should have priority, but was overruled; <!--
page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>and it was agreed that the duel should be fought that
very evening.&nbsp; R&uuml;stow protested that he could not find
another second in so short a time&mdash;General Becker does not
seem to have been available&mdash;but at length it was arranged
that General Bethlem should be asked to fill the office, and that
the duel should take place on the following morning, August
28.&nbsp; There seems to have been considerable difficulty in
finding suitable pistols, and at the last moment General Bethlem
declined to be a second, and Herr von Hofstetten consented to
act.&nbsp; R&uuml;stow called upon Lassalle at the Victoria Hotel
at five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; At half-past six the party started
for Carouge, a village in the neighbourhood of Geneva, which they
reached an hour later.&nbsp; Lassalle was quite cheerful, and
perfectly confident that he would come unharmed out of the
conflict.&nbsp; The opponents faced one another and Racowitza
wounded Lassalle, who was carried by R&uuml;stow and Dr. Seiler
to a coach, and thence to the Victoria Hotel, Geneva.&nbsp; He
suffered dreadfully both then and afterwards, and was only
relieved by a plentiful use of opium.&nbsp; Three days later, on
Wednesday, August 31, 1864, he died.</p>
<p><!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>Was it the chance shot of a delicate boy that killed
one of the most remarkable men of the nineteenth century, or was
it a planned attack upon one who loved the people?&nbsp; This
last view was taken and is still taken by many of his followers;
but it is needless to say that it has no foundation in
fact.&nbsp; Lassalle was killed by a chance shot, and killed in a
duel which had not even the doubtful justification of hatred of
his opponent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Count me no longer as a rival; for you
I have nothing but friendship,&rdquo; were the words written to
Racowitza at the moment that he challenged von D&ouml;nniges, and
he declared on his death-bed that he died by his own hand.</p>
<p>The revolutionists of all lands assembled around his dead
body, which was embalmed by order of the Countess.&nbsp; This
woman talked loudly of vengeance, called not only von Racowitza
but Helen a murderer, <a name="citation218"></a><a
href="#footnote218" class="citation">[218]</a> little thinking
that posterity would judge her more hardly than Helen.&nbsp; She
proposed to take the corpse in solemn procession through Germany;
but an order from the Prussian Government disturbed her plans,
and at Breslau, Lassalle&rsquo;s native town, it was allowed <!--
page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>to rest.&nbsp; Lassalle is buried in the family vault
in the Jewish Cemetery, and a simple monument bears the
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">here rests what is mortal</span><br />
<span class="smcap">of</span><br />
FERDINAND LASSALLE,<br />
<span class="smcap">The</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Thinker and the Fighter</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To understand the whole tragedy and to justify its great
victim is to feel something of the strain which comes to every
thinker and fighter who, like Lassalle, writes and speaks
persistently to vast audiences, often against great odds, and
always with the prospect of a prison before him.&nbsp; That his
nerves were utterly unstrung, that he was not his real self in
those last days, is but too evident.&nbsp; Armed, as he claimed,
with the entire culture of his century, a maker of history if
ever there was one, he became the victim of a love drama which I
suppose that Mr. Matthew Arnold would describe as of the
surgeon&rsquo;s apprentice order: but which, apart from his
political creed, will always endear him to men and women who have
&ldquo;lived and loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>And what shall we say of Helen von D&ouml;nniges?&nbsp;
Her own story is surely one of the most romantic ever
written.&nbsp; In <i>My Relation to Ferdinand Lassalle</i>, she
tells how Yanko broke to her the news that he was going to fight
Lassalle, and how much she grieved.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lassalle will
inevitably kill Yanko,&rdquo; she thought; and she pitied him,
but her pity was not without calculation.&nbsp; &ldquo;When Yanko
is dead and they bring his body here, there will be a stir in the
house,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I can then fly to
Lassalle.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the hours flew by, and finally Yanko
came to tell her that he had wounded his opponent.&nbsp; For the
moment, and indeed until after Lassalle&rsquo;s death, she hated
her successful lover; but a little later his undoubted goodness,
his tenderness and patience, won her heart.&nbsp; They were
married, but he died within a year, of consumption.&nbsp; Being
disowned by her relations, Helen then settled in Berlin, and
studied for the stage.&nbsp; She herself relates how at Breslau
on one occasion, when acting a boy&rsquo;s part in one of
Moser&rsquo;s comedies, some of Lassalle&rsquo;s oldest friends
being present remarked upon her likeness to Lassalle in his
youth, a resemblance on which she and Lassalle had more <!-- page
221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>than once prided themselves.&nbsp; At a later date Frau
von Racowitza married a Russian Socialist, S. E. Shevitch, then
resident in America.&nbsp; M. Shevitch returned to Russia a few
years after this and lived with his wife at Riga.&nbsp; Those who
have seen Madame Shevitch describe her as one of the most
fascinating women they have ever met.&nbsp; She and her husband
were very happy in their married life.&nbsp; Madame Shevitch is
now living in Munich.&nbsp; Our great novelist and poet George
Meredith has immortalized her in his <i>Tragic Comedians</i>.</p>
<h2><!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>VIII.&nbsp; LORD ACTON&rsquo;S LIST
OF THE HUNDRED BEST BOOKS</h2>
<p>Every one has heard of Lord Avebury&rsquo;s (Sir John
Lubbock&rsquo;s) Hundred Best Books, not every one of Lord
Acton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is the privilege of the <i>Pall Mall
Magazine</i> <a name="citation225"></a><a href="#footnote225"
class="citation">[225]</a> to publish this latter list, the final
impression as to reading of one of the most scholarly men that
England has known in our time.&nbsp; The list in question is, as
it were, an omitted chapter of a book that was one of the
successes of its year&mdash;<i>The Letters of Lord Acton to Miss
Mary Gladstone</i>&mdash;published by Mr. George Allen.&nbsp;
That series of letters made very pleasant reading.&nbsp; They
showed Lord Acton not as a Dryasdust, but as a very human
personage indeed, with sympathies invariably in the right
place.</p>
<p><!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>Nor can his literary interests be said to have been
restricted, for he read history and biography with avidity, and
probably knew more of theology than any other layman of modern
times.&nbsp; In imaginative literature, however, his critical
instinct was perhaps less keen.&nbsp; He called Heine &ldquo;a
bad second to Schiller in poetry,&rdquo; which is absurd; and he
thought George Eliot the greatest of modern novelists.&nbsp; In
arriving at the latter judgment he had the excuse of personal
friendship and admiration for a woman whose splendid intellectual
gifts were undeniable.</p>
<p>In one letter we find Lord Acton discussing with Miss
Gladstone the eternal question of the hundred best books.&nbsp;
Sir John Lubbock had complained to her of the lack of a guide or
supreme authority on the choice of books.&nbsp; Lord Acton had
replied that, &ldquo;although he had something to learn on the
graver side of human knowledge,&rdquo; Sir John would execute his
own scheme better than almost anybody.&nbsp; We all know that Sir
John Lubbock attempted this at a lecture delivered at the Great
Ormond Street Working Men&rsquo;s College; that that lecture has
been reprinted again and again in a book entitled <i>The <!--
page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>Pleasures of Life</i>, and that the publishers have
sold more than two hundred thousand copies&mdash;a kind of
success that might almost make some of our popular novelists turn
green with envy.&nbsp; Later on in the correspondence Lord Acton
quoted one of the popes, who said that &ldquo;fifty books would
include every good idea in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Lord Acton, &ldquo;literature has
doubled since then, and it would be hard to do without a
hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Acton was possessed of the happy thought that he would
like some of his friends and acquaintances each to name his ideal
hundred best books&mdash;as for example Bishop Lightfoot, Dean
Church, Dean Stanley, Canon Liddon, Professor Max Muller, Mr. J.
R. Lowell, Professor E. A. Freeman, Mr. W. E. H. Lecky, Mr. John
Morley, Sir Henry Maine, the Duke of Argyll, Lord Tennyson,
Cardinal Newman, Mr. Gladstone, Matthew Arnold, Professor Goldwin
Smith, Mr. R. H. Hutton, Mr. Mark Pattison, and Mr. J. A.
Symonds.&nbsp; Strange to say, he thought there would be a
surprising agreement between these writers as to which were the
hundred best books.&nbsp; I am all but certain, however, that
<!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>there would not have been more than twenty books in
common between rival schools of thought&mdash;the secular and the
ecclesiastical&mdash;between, let us say, Mr. John Morley and
Cardinal Newman.&nbsp; But it is probable that not one of these
eminent men would have furnished a list with any similarity
whatever to the remainder.&nbsp; Each would have written down his
own hundred favourites, and herein may be admitted is an evidence
of the futility of all such attempts.&nbsp; The best books are
the books that have helped us most to see life in all its complex
bearings, and each individual needs a particular kind of mental
food quite unlike the diet that best stimulates his
neighbour.&nbsp; Writing more than a year later, Lord Acton said
that he had just drawn out a list of recommended authors for his
son, as being the company he would like him to keep; but this
list is not available&mdash;it is not the one before me.&nbsp;
That was compiled yet another twelve months afterwards, when we
find Lord Acton sending to Miss Mary Gladstone (Mrs. Drew) his
own ideal &ldquo;hundred best books.&rdquo;&nbsp; This list is
now printed for the first time.&nbsp; Evidently Miss Gladstone
remonstrated with her friend over the <!-- page 229--><a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>character
of the list; but Lord Acton defended it as being in his judgment
really the hundred <i>best books</i>, apart from works on
physical science&mdash;that it treated of principles that every
thoughtful man ought to understand, and was calculated, in fact,
to give one a clear view of the various forces that make
history.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are not considering,&rdquo; he adds,
&ldquo;what will suit an untutored savage or an illiterate
peasant woman, who would never come to an end of the
<i>Imitation</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, here is Lord Acton&rsquo;s list, which Mrs. Drew has
been kind enough to place in the hands of the Editor of the
<i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>.&nbsp; I give also Lord Acton&rsquo;s
comment with which it opens, and I add in footnotes one or two
facts about each of the authors:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;In answer to the question: Which are the hundred best
books in the world?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing any English youth, whose education is
finished, who knows common things, and is not training for a
profession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To perfect his mind and open windows in every
direction, to raise him to the level of his age so that he may
know the (20 or 30) forces that have made our world what it is
and still reign over it, to guard him against surprises and
against the constant sources of error within, <!-- page 230--><a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>to supply
him both with the strongest stimulants and the surest guides, to
give force and fullness and clearness and sincerity and
independence and elevation and generosity and serenity to his
mind, that he may know the method and law of the process by which
error is conquered and truth is won, discerning knowledge from
probability and prejudice from belief, that he may learn to
master what he rejects as fully as what he adopts, that he may
understand the origin as well as the strength and vitality of
systems and the better motive of men who are wrong, to steel him
against the charm of literary beauty and talent; so that each
book, thoroughly taken in, shall be the beginning of a new life,
and shall make a new man of him&mdash;this list is
submitted&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p>This list, written in 1883 in Miss Gladstone&rsquo;s (Mrs.
Drew&rsquo;s) Diary, must always have an interest in the history
of the human mind.</p>
<p>But my readers will, I imagine, for the most part, agree with
me that there are others besides untutored savages and illiterate
peasant women to whom such a list is entirely
impracticable.&nbsp; It indicates the enormous preference which
on the whole Lord Acton gave to the Literature of Knowledge over
the Literature of Power, to use De Quincey&rsquo;s famous
distinction.&nbsp; With the exception of Dante&rsquo;s <i>Divine
Comedy</i> there is practically not a single book that has any
title whatever to a place in the Literature of Power, a
literature which many of us think the only thing in the world of
books worth consideration.&nbsp; Great philosophy is here, and
high thought.&nbsp; <!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>Who would for a moment wish to
disparage St. Bonaventure, the Seraphic Doctor, or Aquinas the
Angelic?&nbsp; Plato and Pascal, Malebranche and Fenelon, Bossuet
and Machiavelli are all among the world&rsquo;s immortals.&nbsp;
Yet now and again we are bewildered by finding the least
important book of a well-known author&mdash;as for example
Rousseau&rsquo;s <i>Poland</i> instead of the <i>Confessions</i>
and Coleridge&rsquo;s <i>Aids to Reflection</i> instead of the
<i>Poems</i> or the <i>Biographia Literaria</i>.&nbsp; Think of
an historian whose ideal of historical work was so high that he
despised all who worked only from printed documents, selecting
the <i>Memorial of St. Helena</i> of Las Casas in preference not
only to a hundred-and-one similar compilations concerning
Napoleon&rsquo;s exile, but in preference to Thucydides,
Herodotus and Gibbon.</p>
<p>Sometimes Lord Acton names a theologian who is absolutely
out-of-date, at others a philosopher who is in the same
case.&nbsp; But on the whole it is a fascinating list as an index
to what a well-trained mind thought the noblest mental equipment
for life&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; At the best, it is true, it would
represent but one half of life.&nbsp; But then Lord Acton
recognized this when he asked that <!-- page 256--><a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>men should
be &ldquo;steeled against the charm of literary beauty and
talent,&rdquo; and he was assuming in any case that all the books
in aesthetic literature, the best poetry and the best history had
already been read, as he undoubtedly had read them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The charm of literary beauty and talent!&rdquo;&nbsp;
There is the whole question.&nbsp; Nothing really matters for the
average man, so far as books are concerned, but this charm, and I
am criticizing Lord Acton&rsquo;s list for the average man.&nbsp;
The student who has got beyond it need not worry himself about
classified lists.&nbsp; He may read his Plato, and Aristotle, his
Pascal and Newman, his Christian apologists and German
theologians, as he wills; or he may read in some other quite
different direction.&nbsp; Guidance is impossible to a mind at
such a stage of cultivation as Lord Acton had in view.</p>
<p>Only minds at a more primitive stage of culture than this most
learned and most accomplished man seemed able to conceive of,
could be bettered by advice as to reading.&nbsp; Given, indeed,
contact with some superior mind, which out of its rich equipment
of culture should advise <!-- page 257--><a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>as to the
books that might be most profitably read, I could imagine advice
being helpful.&nbsp; It would be of no value, it is true, to an
untutored savage or illiterate peasant, but to a youth fresh from
school-books and much modern fiction, to a young girl about to
enter upon life in its more serious aspects, it would be
immensely serviceable.&nbsp; It was of such as these that Mr.
Ruskin thought when he wrote of &ldquo;King&rsquo;s
Treasures&rdquo; in <i>Sesame and Lilies</i>, and the same idea
was doubtless in Sir John Lubbock&rsquo;s mind when he lectured
on the &ldquo;Hundred Best Books.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Lord
Avebury&rsquo;s list had its limitations, it seems to me, for any
one who has an interest in good literature and guidance to the
reading thereof.&nbsp; To give &ldquo;Scott&rdquo; as one book
and &ldquo;Shakspere&rdquo; as another was I suggest to shirk
much responsibility of selection.&nbsp; Scott is a whole library,
Shakspere is yet another.&nbsp; One may give &ldquo;Keats&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Shelley&rdquo; because they are more limited in
quantity.&nbsp; Even to name novels by Charles Kingsley and
Bulwer Lytton in this select hundred was to demonstrate to men of
this generation that Lord Avebury being of an earlier one had a
bias in favour of the books <!-- page 258--><a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>that we are
all outgrowing.&nbsp; To include Mill&rsquo;s <i>Logic</i> is to
ignore the Time Spirit acting on philosophy; to include
Tennyson&rsquo;s <i>Idylls</i> its action on poetry.&nbsp; Mill
and Tennyson will always live in literature but not I think by
these books.</p>
<p>But the fact is that there is no possibility of naming the
hundred best books.&nbsp; No one could quarrel with Lord Avebury
if he had named these as his hundred own favourites among the
books of the world.&nbsp; Still, it might have been <i>his</i>
hundred; it could not possibly have been any one else&rsquo;s
hundred because every man of education must make his own
choice.&nbsp; No! the naming of the hundred best books for any
large, general audience is quite impossible.&nbsp; All that is
possible in such a connexion is to state emphatically that there
are very few books that are equally suitable to every kind of
intellect.&nbsp; Temperament as well as intellectual endowment
make for so much in reading.&nbsp; Take, for example, the
<i>Imitation</i> of <i>Christ</i>.&nbsp; George Eliot, although
not a Christian, found it soul-satisfying.&nbsp; Thackeray, as I
think a more robust intellect, found it well nigh as mischievous
as did Eugene Sue, whose <!-- page 259--><a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>anathematizations in his novel <i>The Wandering Jew</i>
are remembered by all.&nbsp; Other books that have been the
outcome of piety of mind leave less room for difference of
opinion.&nbsp; Surely Dante&rsquo;s <i>Divine Comedy</i>, and
Bunyan&rsquo;s <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, make an universal
appeal.&nbsp; That universal appeal is the point at which alone
guidance is possible.&nbsp; There are great books that can be
read only by the few, but surely the very greatest appeal alike
to the educated and the illiterate, to the man of rich
intellectual endowment and to the man to whom all processes of
reasoning are incomprehensible.&nbsp; <i>Hamlet</i> is a
wonderful test of this quality.&nbsp; It &ldquo;holds the
boards&rdquo; at the small provincial theatre, it is enacted by
Mr. Crummles to an illiterate peasantry, and it is performed by
the greatest actor to the most select city audience.&nbsp; It is
made the subject of study by learned commentators.&nbsp; It is
world-embracing.</p>
<p>Are there in the English language, including translations, a
hundred books that stand the test as <i>Hamlet</i> stands
it?&nbsp; No two men would make the same list of books that
answer to this demand of an universal appeal, and obviously each
nation <!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>must make its own list.&nbsp; Mine
is for English boys and girls just growing into manhood and
womanhood, or for those who have had no educational advantages in
early years.&nbsp; I exclude living writers, and I give the
hundred in four groups.</p>

will not make him a prig, as Mr. James Payn said that Lord

appeal.&nbsp; The learned man may enjoy them, the unlearned may
enjoy them also.&nbsp; They are, as <i>Hamlet</i> is, of
universal interest.&nbsp; Devotion to science will not impair a
taste for them, nor will zest for abstract speculations.&nbsp;

poetry&rdquo; can fail to appreciate.&nbsp; These hundred books
will in the main be the hundred best books of many of my readers

subscribing for some cheap series which will save him the trouble
of selecting.&nbsp; He may buy many books from such cheap series

should be acquired through much saving, and purchased with great
thought and deliberation.&nbsp; The purchase of a book should
become to the young book-lover a most solemn function.</p>

the following characteristic letter dated December 8,
1903:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . For my part I should leave George Borrow alone,
to take his own part even as Isopel Berners learnt to take hers
in the great house at Long Melford.&nbsp; He has an appealing
voice which no sooner falls on the ear of the born Borrovian,
than up the lucky fellow must get and follow his master to the
end of the chapter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, if you will insist upon going out into the
highways and hedges and compelling the wayfaring man&mdash;though
a fool&mdash;to come in and take a seat at the <i>Lavengro</i>
feast, nobody can stop you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great thing is to get people to read the Borrow
books: there is nothing else to be done.&nbsp; If, after having
read them, some enthusiasts go on to learn <i>Romany</i> and seek
to trace authorities on Gypsies and Gypsy lore&mdash;why, let
them.&nbsp; They may soon know more about Gypsies than Borrow
ever did&mdash;but they will never write about them as he
did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The essence of the matter is to enjoy Borrow&rsquo;s
books for themselves alone.&nbsp; As for Borrow&rsquo;s
biography, it appears to me either that he has already written
it, or it is not worth writing.&nbsp; Anyhow, place the books in
the forefront, reprint things as often as you dare without
<i>note or comment</i> or even <i>prefatory appreciation</i>, and
you cannot but earn the gratitude of every true Borrovian who in
consequence of your efforts come upon the Borrow books for the
first time.&rdquo;</p>

affair is contained in the story of Sophie Solutzeff, entitled,
<i>Eine Liebes-episode aus dem Leben Ferdinand
Lassalle&rsquo;s</i>.&nbsp; This booklet, which is published in
German, French, and Russian, professes to be an account of
Lassalle&rsquo;s love for a young Russian lady, Sophie Solutzeff,
some two years before he met Helene von D&ouml;nniges.&nbsp; He
is represented as being himself in a frenzy of passion; the lady,
however, rejecting as a lover the man she had been prepared to
worship as a teacher.&nbsp; There can be little doubt that the
whole story is a fabrication, in which the Countess von Hatzfeldt
had a considerable part.&nbsp; The Countess was rightly judged by
popular opinion to have played a discreditable r&ocirc;le in the
love passages between Lassalle and Helene; and Helene&rsquo;s own
account of the matter in her <i>Reminiscences</i> was an
additional blow at the pseudo-friend who might have helped the
lovers so much.&nbsp; What more natural than that the Countess
should be anxious to break the force of Helene&rsquo;s
indictment, by endorsing the popular, and indeed accurate
judgment, that Lassalle was very inflammable where women were
concerned.&nbsp; This she could do by depicting him, a little
earlier, in precisely similar bondage to that which he had
professed to Helene.&nbsp; That the Countess wrote, or assisted
to write, the compilation of letters and diaries, does not,
however, destroy its value as a record of Lassalle&rsquo;s
struggle on her behalf.&nbsp; That account, if not written by
Lassalle, was written or inspired by the other great actor in the
Hatzfeldt drama, and may therefore be considered a fairly safe
guide in recounting the story.&nbsp; Mr. Israel Zangwill, since
the above was written, has published an article on Lassalle in
his <i>Dreamers of the Ghetto</i>.&nbsp; He accepts Sophie
Solutzeff&rsquo;s story as genuine, but that is merely the
credulity of an accomplished romancer.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
